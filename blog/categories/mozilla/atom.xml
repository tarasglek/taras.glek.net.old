    <content type="html"><![CDATA[###Frontend

####Help-Wanted:

Avi Halachmi [needs your help](http://avih.github.com/blog/2013/02/28/slow-touchpad-scroll-in-firefox/) comparing scrolling behavior between browsers.

####Australis

Mike Conley [blogged](http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2013/03/01/australis-curvy-tabs-more-progress/) that Australis performance is now on-par with current theme on low-end hardware.


###Startup

Aaron Klotz landed <a title="Generic readahead functions" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845907">bug 845907</a>. This gives us a consistent way to warm IO caches. This functionality can easily backfire if we end preloading data that does not get used. Uses of readahead should always be accompanied with telemetry to verify it performs as expected. <a title="Use fadvise() to speed up cookie db load" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=810454">Bug 810454</a> is the first user of readahead API, it landed with A/B testing telemetry.
Omnijar readhead is next, in <a title="Use readahead for ordered jar files such as omni.ja. Should be ~10% startup speedup" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=810151">bug 810151</a>. It results in ~60% drop in omni.ja startup read time on Windows on Aaron's machine.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[###Lack of Updates

I skipped a Snappy update two-weeks ago (did anyone notice?) due to not having any completed work to report. Snappy has not stagnated, we have big projects inflight see this week's [notes](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2013-02-21) for some details.

###Tab Smoothness

I usually do not cover in-flight work in Snappy updates and expect individual developers to blog about stuff they are working on. However, Avi Halachmi has delayed blogging to focus on quickly advancing Firefox performance, an exception had to me made.

Avi has been investigating tab smoothness since December. His approach relies on detailed instrumentation + sending captured data via Telemetry. This culminated in some exciting bug activity this week:

* <a title="Add telemetry probes for tab animation smoothness" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=828097">bug 828097</a> According to Telemetry, Firefox tab animations are quite smooth (due to recent improvements like <a title="requestAnimationFrame generates too short/long frames, especially at the beginning of animation" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731974">bug 731974</a>) iff one has the newtab thumbnail feature disabled (via button in top right of the page).
* <a title="Newtab page slows down tab-open animation" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=843853">bug 843853</a> was filed to fix above performance hit ASAP.
* <a title="Cache GradientStops instead of gfxPatterns" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=838758">bug 838758</a> 20-25% tab animation speedup on Direct2D-accelerated systems.
* <a title="Refresh driver may re-target the same timestamp" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=842967">bug 842967</a>, <a title="Consider getting rid of the delay line filter stuff in timer thread" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=590422">bug 590422</a> improve animation scheduling.

Due to web-like Firefox UI architecture most of these improvements will enable smoother website perf.

Avi, Matthew Noorenberghe, Mike Conley are working on optimizing our next UI refresh: Australis. Australis is shaping up to be the most perf-tuned theme update we've done. See <a title="Australis tabs performance tracking" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=837885">bug 837885</a> for how performance is being tracked.

As Avi's manager I found it trying to see weeks of perf-reporting work with no fixes to accompany it. I'm happy to see this investigation investment pay off and serve an example of importance of methodically studying performance before proceeding to optimization.

    <id>http://taras.glek.net/blog/2013/02/15/plugin-hang-ui-on-aurora</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Aaron wrote a [great post](http://dblohm7.ca/blog/2013/02/15/plugin-hang-ui-on-aurora/) on of the new plugin killer UI and Windows magic involved in debugging it. 

We need help testing the new functionality, please see the link above for details.

Unfortunately, we are still waiting on <a title="Add Aaron Klotz's blog to Planet Mozilla" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814095">bug 814095</a> to get his blog syndicated to planet.

    <link href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2013/02/15/is-planet-mozilla-obsolete/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-15T11:21:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://taras.glek.net/blog/2013/02/15/is-planet-mozilla-obsolete</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[##Good Old Days
I have been remotely working at Mozilla for over 6 years. I like working remotely, but it poses some challenges. Early on I discovered that if I only show up at the HQ a couple times a year, most will people treat me as a stranger. That got old fast.

The problem is that it takes a lot of time time to get everybody up to speed on who you are (defined by what you work on). This means one's work social circle is limited to people who you have frequent bugzilla/irc interactions with + random people who took the time to get to know a random coworker. One can imagine that introverts are not inclined to waste too much energy meeting new people.

The solution was simple: blog a lot. After a couple years of blogging I just had to say "I'm Taras" and a good proportion of the people would connect my face to (obscure static analysis at first) work they read about on [planet](http://planet.mozilla.org). This cut down my introduction overhead significantly. Planet Mozilla had a lot of blogs syndicated to it when I joined. I had a huge audience to introduce my work to.

In addition to creating awareness of my work, blogging about tough problems would occasionally result in helpful comments. People provided tips on static analysis, Windows APIs and even ran scary privileged software I wrote to help me gather data. Due to disproportionate (eg saving days to weeks of work) value of helpful comments I concluded that it's worth spending a couple hours per blog post. Most blog comments might be [garbage](http://davidwalsh.name/blog-comments), but they are easy to ignore. Before I implemented [telemetry](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry), I was able to find performance extremes solely on blog feedback. Unlike privacy-sensitive telemetry data, blog comments came with email addresses and eager volunteers on the other end. I value comments a lot, it makes me sad when good bloggers disable comments.

To me Planet Mozilla was a great way to keep up with Mozilla technical affairs. We have a lot of smart people working on interesting problems at Mozilla. As a result of past planet experience, I ask every new person who joins the Performance team to get their blog syndicated to planet ASAP. Increasingly that feels like an unproductive suggestion.

##Present

I do not have any data on this. However my feeling is that the volume of blog traffic on planet grew from barely-manageable in the early days to too much. Good technical content never constituted more than 10% of the planet posts. However as absolute blog traffic grew, it became harder to spot the good stuff. In addition to a lot of content being non-technical, in the last few years people started discussing their feelings about others and things got ugly.

I'm pretty sure the result is that there are fewer technical people reading planet than before(due to poor signal/noise ratio). Lack of audience means less incentive to blog (that and the fact that some bloggers are part of the audience that gave up on planet).

So what are we to do? Is planet obsolete for good technical content? Is there a new reddit/hackernews/twitter self-moderating solution for dealing with signal problems? Surely setting up a new planet is no longer considered state of the art for this. 

I am sad to see a public resource like the planet get too big to remain useful with no clear successor.


ps. Sorry for adding to the non-technical noise.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[###Graphics
In some cases Direct2D-accelerated drawing is slower than the non-accelerated path. Jeff Muizelaar fixed a severe gradient 'hang' in <a title="Avoid hitting D2D slow path when drawing radial gradients from css" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=823147">bug 823147</a>.

Avi Halachmi diagnosed a significant menu performance issue in <a title="Menu items slow to paint/respond after peeking their sub-menu popups" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=832641">bug 832641</a>, this was promptly fixed by Matt Woodrow.

###Misc Pauses
Vladan Djeric [blogged](https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/2013/01/24/add-on-performance-problems/) about top main-thread SQL issues contributed by addons. Vladan also produced a [chromehang](http://people.mozilla.com/~vdjeric/DecJanHangs.txt) report for last 2 months.

Ehsan Akhgari fixed a *chromehang* caused by leftover debug code: <a title="Multi-second hang during CollectNewLoadedModules" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=830765">bug 830765</a>.

Justin Lebar fixed an issue where telemetry memory reporting code was accidentally triggering expensive 'release memory to OS' operations: <a title="Extremely long pause while collecting telemetry information on the main thread" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=789975">bug 789975</a>.

###Shutdown
Sometimes Firefox takes a long time to shutdown. We also have a timer that regularly triggers cycle collection. Olli Pettay disabled this timer during shutdown in <a title="Timer based CC occurring on shutdown" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=822849">bug 822849</a>.
