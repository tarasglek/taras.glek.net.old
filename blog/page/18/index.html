  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Static Analysis vs Performance</strong></p>

<p>Two months ago I got the feeling that I gotta take a break from static analysis and do something that obviously affects Firefox at runtime. Luckily that coincided with ramp-up on Fennec performance work.</p>

<p>I find that I enjoy fixing existing code a lot more than other sorts of programming, so I was extremely happy to switch focus from the static analysis way of fixing code to my other favourite: optimization. Both are peculiar programming endeavours because after a bunch of gruntwork the program ends up doing the exact same thing as before, but better.</p>

<p>In static analysis I focus more on how different pieces fit together, whereas in an optimization I get to focus on what various pieces are trying to achieve so I learned a lot more random Mozilla mysteries.</p>

<p><strong>Fennec</strong></p>

<p>Fennec is pure joy to optimize because it runs in such a constrained Linux environment (compared to desktop Linux). Things seem to happen roughly 10x slower on the arm processor than on my core2duo laptop. Thus performance details that are hard to spot on the desktop almost trivial to discover.</p>

<p>There is no hard drive seeks to introduce unpleasant surprise latency. This simplifies things a lot - there is a lot less variance between hot and cold start on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810">n810</a> than on hard drived desktop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the N810 linux environment also leaves a lot to be desired. Compiling stuff is a chore. It turns out the oprofile produces nonsense results when a compiler of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Build/cs2007q3">recent</a> vintage is used (ancient one cant really compile Mozilla).</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun digging deep into Mozilla code and dealing with <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=465128">mischievous</a> timestamps, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=465556">misbehaving</a> caches and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=466877">rude</a> GC interruptions. All this was done using <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470116">stone-age</a> instrumentation techniques on N810.</p>

<p>Mark Finkle blogged some <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2008/12/fennec-alpha2-performance/">details</a> on Fennec Alpha2 performance. Alpha2 is magnitudes faster than Alpha1, I expect more of the same in subsequent releases.</p>

<p><strong>Software Improvements ThatÂ  Santa Claus Should Get Me </strong></p>

<p>Even though <a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/">oprofile</a> is useless on N810, one can get a pretty good idea of what the performance issues are from running it on x86. OProfile is a little rough to use, but I&#8217;ve learned to love it when sugared with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot">gprof2dot</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot">xdot</a>. It&#8217;s great for locating places in the code to stick printf()s into.</p>

<p>OProfile has taught me that what I really want is Dtrace (or some knockoff) running on n810.</p>

<p>Also, I really hate how embedded Linux takes away one of coolest things about Desktop Linux: ability to compile own kernel. I haven&#8217;t been able to get a more modern kernel to run on N810 which means I can&#8217;t try a newer version of oprofile or the new omap high res timers. I would also like to get a working image of N810 under qemu, but success has avoided me there too.</p>

<p><strong>Static Stuff</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately I found that can&#8217;t effectively work on static analysis stuff without giving it my full and undivided attention. Right now I&#8217;m hoping to set aside time to focus on writing a more general dead code finder and catch up on other misc things sometime in Janurary or February.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been running my prbool checker with nightly notifications for about a year now. There are some false positivies, but mostly it picks up real bugs. The checker pulls the blame source to try to guess who is responsible for the error, but so far it has only been emailing me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make it emailed the hg blamed person starting this weekend, so if you commit something and get an email from me complaining about it don&#8217;t take it too personally. Hopefully this will keep the amount of new detectable prbool bugs at 0. If you do get an email and decide you don&#8217;t want to get these in the future, please complain and we&#8217;ll try to come up with a better notification solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Open Source projects are often like parallel worlds. People reach the same conclusions, attempt similar solutions and are typically blissfully unaware of each other&#8217;s existance.</p>

<p>Here are two projects that came to my attention this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Via Planet KDE I stumbled on <a href="http://www.englishbreakfastnetwork.org/krazy/">Krazy</a>. It&#8217;s neat if not somewhat depressing that even if C++ parsers are finally becoming accessible all this is still Perl.</li>
<li>Helpful comment on my previous entry pointed me to <a href="http://blogs.linux.ie/caolan/">dead method hunting</a> in OpenOffice.
<strong>Uncool Open Source Rant</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Reason I switched to linux was because it seemed like a developer&#8217;s dream come true. Compilers are a package manager operation away (and generally aren&#8217;t tied to OS versions, I&#8217;m looking at you Apple), everything can be recompiled to address any particular concerns and there are crapload of weird languages to write your software in. This is especially awesome when compared to a typical proprietory software stack where one can&#8217;t easily fix problems that involve multiple components due to licensing issues or due to not having the code available(or due to not having the development environment available). So one would think that Linux distributions hold the ultimate software power: unlimited pass to modify their offering to their target audience&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my view of Linux ways is unrealistic. For example when people do <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/299483/">friggin&#8217; awesome work</a> knocking down boot time to 5 seconds by hacking and slashing their way through the entire software stack involved in boottime delays, distributions claim that it&#8217;s not somethin they can seriously consider because they are too set in their ways of general purpose(and generally bloated) init systems and stock kernels(worst case: why can&#8217;t we recompile the kernel on the user&#8217;s machine or ship a couple of custom variations for common hardware out there). What&#8217;s the point of open source if we continue pretending that everything is a general purpose black box that doesn&#8217;t like to play together? It&#8217;s been two weeks and I haven&#8217;t seen a single distro bite the bullet and attempt to list 5 second boot in their goals. Come on guys, don&#8217;t you like to be challenged?</p>

<p>Hope someone proves me wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my quest to rid Firefox of code that doesn&#8217;t do anything it is possible to screw up and delete a method that is only used by outside code. So far, I&#8217;ve hit a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457302">component</a> that isn&#8217;t used in Firefox, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457965">methods</a> that aren&#8217;t used in Firefox and methods that <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458983">claim</a> someone is about to use them (with a timestamp from 8 years ago). That and I discovered some code only appears to be used from BeOS or OS/2 specific ifdefs.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, I had someone comment that I do some &#8220;dangerous shit&#8221;. Sure, I can see why someone would think that.</p>

<p>My protection: I use the try server to make sure that everything builds on supported platforms. On top of that every patch gets reviewed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I would like to point out that methods that aren&#8217;t called within Firefox are less likely to be tested and correct. So if one leaves code that should only be called from other projects, it&#8217;d be appropriate if we had some unit tests for it, which would flag the code as in-use. That would let us move to the next level and setup a tinderbox to detect dead code as soon as it is orphaned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The coolest part about my job is that I get to work on tasks that are cool, but typically are forever laid to rest in the would-be-cool-if-we-could-but-we-don&#8217;t-have-time-or-resources category. However as project code sizes increases, the usefulness/coolness ratio of static analysis grows and moves from would-be-cool, to nice-to-have to this-is-the-only-way. Now, I&#8217;m not sure where Mozilla lies on this scale, but I do know for sure that the giant codebase is an analysis treasure trove.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Code Motivation </strong></p>

<p>I have been talking about dead code detection in Mozilla for ages. As software changes, some pieces of code unintentially get left behind, but often there is no way to tell. It results in unnessary maintanance burden and increased footprint. In <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/">roc</a>&#8217;s case randomly spotting dead methods may also involve a little IRC griping at me about not having any tools for it, even rudimentary ones. Between that and <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=766">blizzard&#8217;s cheering</a> over reduced code size, I had no choice, but to give it a try once I had enough outparamdelling being reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Code Results</strong></p>

<p>First of, the approach described below seems to work well: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457262">see bug</a> with initial results. Now I get a few thousand reported methods to inspect and refine the results.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Code Approach</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been pondering dead code detection since I&#8217;ve started working on this stuff. There are lots of ways to do it, but I finally settled on the dead-simplest one: method-level granularity. <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/deadlive/">Ingredients</a> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dehydra/Treehydra extraction JavaScript: Dehydra makes it easy to enumerate methods and class hierarchies. Treehydra makes it possible to extract every mention of a method from the code(except for <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/events/src/nsEventListenerManager.cpp#206">pointers to virtual functions that were casted</a>&#8230;in that case we are left with vtable index and a type that the pointer was cast to). Additionally, Treehydra counts the number of AST nodes visited in every function body.</li>
<li>Shell script to aggregate the result of processing Mozilla source. Gotta admit, perl&#8217;s hashtables give GNU sort -u a run for its money.</li>
<li>Ocaml program to do the super-dumb algorithm. Classes with the same names, are assumed to be the same class. Method overloads are assumed to be a single method. All methods are assumed to be virtual. Every ClassType::FUNCTION_CALL call walks down to all children &amp; up through all the parents and marks the derived methods as called. Then all derivatives of scriptable XPIDL are filtered out and the uncalled methods are printed out. In order to find most exciting functions first, methods in the results are sorted by their AST count =D. <strong>Language Nerd Trivia:</strong> Why OCaml - because ADTs are no fun in other languages. Why is my OCaml so bad - because I lost the hang out if due to not writing anything it for the past 2 years.
I&#8217;m sure most people reading this will go: &#8220;Wait a minute, this is unsound if you don&#8217;t see the virtual function pointers?&#8221;, to which I reply: &#8220;Once I nuke the method and mozilla compiles successfully, it&#8217;s sound&#8221;. In reality someone could make a puny GCC patch to preserve more data in virtual function pointer assignments.</li>
</ul>


<p>Since this is all in early stages there a bunch of things I don&#8217;t deal with: method overloads, constructors, destructors and overloaded operators&#8230;.and templates. All function bodies are scanned, but some function names are a pain to deal with or they aren&#8217;t straightforward function calls in GCC so they don&#8217;t participate in the dead/alive contest.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Go From Here</strong></p>

<p>Well, once we run out of dead code detected by the primitive caveman approach above, we&#8217;ll have to investigate less conservative approaches possibly involving abstract interpretation and callgraphs.</p>

<p><strong>How To Get Involved in Screwing With Software Cost Models By Contributing Negative Line Counts </strong></p>

<p>This project has a lot of places to help out:</p>

<ul>
<li>work through the dead method list, filing bugs accordingly and deleting any related code</li>
<li>Extend the machinery to work on all non-static function</li>
<li>Try this on your favourite large codebase.</li>
<li>Write the virtual function pointer annotation patch :)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I dusted off outparamdel to see if I can get some refactorings landed. About a year ago, with the great QueryInterface outparamdelling experiment we ended up with a smaller binary footprint and tiny performance gain, but that never landed due to us not wanting to break compatability yet. Ever since, outparamdel has been patiently bitrotting within <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Pork">Pork</a> waiting for the day it&#8217;s allowed to break APIs.</p>

<p>Recently jst <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:DeCOMtamination">listed</a> some private API candidates for deCOMtamination and I have been letting outparamdel loose on them for the past week. So far only one such <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-rev/ec4733eb1bd8">change</a> has been committed, the rest are sitting in jst&#8217;s review queue. It&#8217;s exciting, as it&#8217;s the first ever application of outparamdel that didn&#8217;t get canned. For the whole list see the most recent bugs blocking my <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430328">analysis metabug</a>.</p>

<p>Cool part about these patches is that after various outparamdel special-casing and manual cleanup the line count is reduced by 10-30% while maintaining existing functionality!</p>

<p>So far I haven&#8217;t touched much outside of content/, so if you know of any APIs that could have the outparam rotated into the return value, file some rewriting bugs against me.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting with Mercurial</strong></p>

<p>Mercurial is now my favourite python program ever. It makes rewrites so easy. Here is my typical workflow:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Write an outparamdel input file specifying functions to rewrite..run outparamdel with pork-barrel to generate patch
</span><span class='line'>hg qimport -f autopatch.diff && hg qpush && hg qref #make the patch nice and readable
</span><span class='line'>hg qnew manual.diff #create a manual cleanup patch for cosmetic touchups and rewrites screwed up by macros#of course to submit patch for review, those two patches need to be combined
</span><span class='line'>#do manual stuff
</span><span class='line'>hg diff -r 19277 #produce a combined diff without loosing ability to edit each applied patch individually! For example, can regenerate the autopatch.diff with different outparamdel parameters or a bugfixed outparamdel. 19277 is a revision that has to be looked up with hg log, unfortunately there isn't a relative syntax to do hg diff -r "tip - 2"
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a huge improvement over the ad-hoc workflow prior to hg switch when I was prototyping my tools. CVS + quilt don&#8217;t hold a candle to a modern revision control system.</p>

<p><strong>Prcheck</strong></p>

<p>I also have been doing another round of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=266048">prbool corrections</a>. Somehow I didn&#8217;t notice that the system stopped working due to the CVS->hg switch. Once again when reviving my nightly checker scripts, it was a pleasure to substitute all of the CVS hacks with mercurial commands.</p>

<p>I am waiting for the few remaining largeish (ie 3-4 bugs per file) patches to land before I can start submitting whackamole bugs with a single prbool correction per module.</p>

<p>It also seems that cairo and every other pre-C99 project have the same set of issues as Mozilla with their typedefed-int boolean types. Perhaps prcheck isn&#8217;t mozilla-specific at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago, Igor mentioned that there is code in SpiderMonkey that pleads to the programmer that from a certain point in a function code must flow through a label(ie a finalizer block). <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Treehydra">Treehydra</a> made it to possible to turn that weak plea into an error message when static <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/En/Building_with_static_checking">checking is enabled</a>. See the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=432917">bug</a> for more details. My favourite static analyses are all about turning informal &#8220;gurantees&#8221; into angry compiler complaints.</p>

<p>This is my first static analysis that landed in the mozilla-central tree. It&#8217;s also the simplest one and may be a decent starting point for solving similar problems. I&#8217;d be cool to see this particular feature utilized outside of SpiderMonkey. Unlike human-powered code-inspection, it excels at finding accidental early returns covered up by macros.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Certain other cool open source projects are doing cool static analysis work. In this case, <a href="http://yoyodyne.ath.cx/ccc-analyze/buildkernel/2008-08-16-1/">here</a> is an analysis of one of my favourite operating systems projects, <a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org/">DragonFly BSD</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m blown away by the clean UI. The error filter and the interleaving of static analysis results in the source code are drool-inducing. This is powered by the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">clang checker</a>. Clang&#8217;s checker doesn&#8217;t yet do C++, doesn&#8217;t do application-specific checks and has a lot of false positives, but it&#8217;s an exciting preview of things to come.</p>

<p>Oh and I hope that DXR will have similar analysis awesomeness. In the future, I hope to see static analysis become almost as common as unit-testing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the purposes of this blog is to inform people that while the original <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/">Elsa author</a> is no longer actively developing it, Elsa is being used in production at Mozilla and is actively maintained within <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Pork">Pork</a>.</p>

<p>Recently two previously unknown to me Elsa forks have come to my attention via comments on my blog. Both of these are extrimely cool and something we have been wanting:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ellcc.org/">ellcc</a> C (and soon C++) compiler via Elsa + LLVM. I&#8217;ve heard of attempts to get this to work before, but this looks like it is much further along than similar efforts.</li>
<li>Alex Telia&#8217;s souped up elsa with parser error recovery and an integrated C preprocessor among other awesomeness. See <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2008/06/30/pork-09-in-the-wild/#comment-18303">this comment</a> for more details. Some of <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~lvoinea/VCN.html">these tools</a> are built on this Elsa fork.
Both of these projects are interested in converging on a single codebase. It sounds like Alex&#8217;s work will be ready for merging soon.</li>
</ul>


<p>I love open source.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone else is developing their own app-specific rewrite tools. In this case app-specific refers to <a href="http://people.imendio.com/richard/gtk-rewriter/">automating porting code</a> from gtk2 to gtk3. The approach is similar in that patches are produced, but it doesn&#8217;t look like a patch aggregating tool is written yet. Instead of the elsa/mcpp magic sauce, <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> is being used, so this is limited to C at the moment.</p>

<p>KDE folks are behind in automated code rewrites arms race, perhaps the trolls should try some <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Pork">pork</a> to accelerate KDE3->4 transition :)</p>

<p>All kidding aside, it is awesome to see that less-manual-labour-through-compiler-assisted-refactoring approach is gaining mindshare.</p>
