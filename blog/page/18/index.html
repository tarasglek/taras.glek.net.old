  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a class renamer and used it to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445897">fix</a> my pork pet-pieve #1: a class named string that isn&#8217;t std::string. This has been a low priority goal for as long as I&#8217;ve been using Elsa. It&#8217;s pretty cool to apply a tool to fix itself.</p>

<p>The renamer is a 3x simpler than the next simplest tool. I plan to extend it to also rename class members. Renaming is the most trivial use-case for rewriting code, I plan to post a tutorial on usingÂ  the renamer in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that there is some confusion as to what pork is and how it&#8217;s related to oink and elsa. So here is my view of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Pork"><strong>Pork</strong></a> is my set of tools that use Elsa to rewrite sourcecode (mainly Mozilla code). Our use of Pork is solely for rewriting as it is not suited for <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Dehydra">convenient</a> and <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Treehydra">hardcore</a> analysis needs as much as the GCC based tools are.</p>

<p><a href="http://mcpp.sf.net/">MCPP</a> is the secret sauce C preprocessor that makes C++ rewriting with Elsa possible by annotating preprocessed files with information to undo the lexical braindamage resulting from macro expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Elsa</strong> is a awesome C++ parser. Awesome in that is can preserve more information regarding parsed code than any other C/C++ parser and it is easy to extend.</p>

<p>We maintain our own version of Elsa within pork.</p>

<p>I think our version of Elsa is the most up to date and most compatible with newer C++ features and headers used by newer GCC releases. We encourage other projects with C++ parsing/rewriting needs to collaborate with us. We will be parsing code with Elsa for a few years to come and it&#8217;s a lot of work to maintain a C++ parser by a single entity. I think elsa is a much better backend to build refactoring support onto than any other C++ parsing project out there right now.</p>

<p><strong>The Messy Details</strong></p>

<p>Now lets move on the more confusing parts: oink, oink-stack, and the oink mailing list.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cubewano.org/oink"><strong>oink</strong></a> consists of some static analysis tools and was meant to be a central place where all of the Elsa and Elsa-related development was supposed to happen. When people refer to oink, they usually mean the oink-stack which is a subversion meta repository that pulls in a dozen of subrepositoes(smbase, elkhound, elsa, oink(where static analysis tools live), etc).</p>

<p>So when I started working on refactoring tools I was told that I should aim to have my tools added to oink, but there were some legal hassles to work out in the meantime so I cloned the oink-stack and developed my tools with minimal changes to oink-stack. This included various elsa extensions, bugfixes, etc.</p>

<p>However, the little momentum that oink had has fizzled out due to various personality conflicts and various academics loosing interest. The code has been bitrotting for as long as I&#8217;ve been working at Mozilla.</p>

<p>So the end result of oink is that we have pork which is a superset of oink. I&#8217;m not even sure if I mention the name pork anywhere in the sources. So pork at the moment means &#8220;Taras&#8217; continuation and extension of oink&#8221;. I am using the <a href="http://www.cubewano.org/lists/listinfo/oink-devel">oink mailing list</a> for any discussion on changes to Elsa/etc in hopes that at least some of the genius lurkers there will regain their interest in elsa.</p>

<p><strong>Where do We Go From Here?</strong></p>

<p>Onward! Due to the original authors vision of what C++ is and the state of C++ at the time Elsa was conceived, current pork code causes people to have many WTF moments (followed by banging head against keyboard) when they first start using it.</p>

<p>The short version of my plan is:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow one to do &#8220;using namespace std&#8221; when using elsa</li>
<li>Restructure pork repositories such that there are only 3 of them rather than 11 (elsa, elkhound, pork)</li>
<li>get rid of the oink repository (those tools do not work for us)</li>
<li>Make pork only consist of just my tools (with a sane build system) rather than be mixed into unmainted oink stuff</li>
<li>Make pork compile with new compilers (GCC 4.3 and recent MSVC++)</li>
<li>Keep track of this in a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=438061">bug</a></li>
<li>Clean up various misc things
Some of you might ask &#8220;But Taras, why now, why not just keep doing what you&#8217;ve been doing?&#8221;. I was doing what I was doing because I had an overwhelming goal of devising a way to automate static analysis and refactoring of Mozilla on my shoulders and I wasn&#8217;t convinced that it was feasible. I had to learn to split my time between tool development and actually using the tools. Naturally I cut corners on tool development :)</li>
</ul>


<p>Since then slowly, but surely various awesome hackers have started doing rewrites and analyses themselves freeing me up to focus more on development. To make matters sweeter, various hackers have started submitting bugreports, fixes, ports to my tools. This gives me more time to focus on the big picture.</p>

<p>Finally, I belive that automation of the sort we are doing at Mozilla is something that has been missing from open source development practices and it will catch on once people realize what they&#8217;ve been missing. Reducing those WTF moments will help people think positively.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p><em>Why three repositories instead of one?</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The three will be elkhound, elsa, pork</li>
<li>elkhound is useful on it&#8217;s own</li>
<li>elsa is too and other elsa users are likely to not care about Mozilla&#8217;s rewriting tools
<em>I__s oink really dead?</em></li>
</ol>


<p>Yes. The maintainers have moved on to other projects. When they were maintaining oink, outside contributors couldn&#8217;t get their code upstream.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Hydras</strong></p>

<p>I am close to landing a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=432917">flow</a> check. Turns out, it is super-easy to introduce new analyses into Mozilla due to a very nice build system hooks setup by bsmedberg.</p>

<p>Since coming back from the GCC summit I have forward-ported our GCC patches to GCC trunk. The FSF legal paperwork came through today so I posted the first and biggest patch to the GCC for <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2008-07/msg00741.html">review</a>.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I mentioned this before, but the C port of <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Dehydra">Dehydra</a> is somewhat operational. It doesn&#8217;t yet have access to function bodies, but type traversal should work. Unfortunately, the C frontend has less features(pretty printing sucks, locations are even less reliable, etc) and thus is less awesome to work with than the C++ frontend.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Pork"><strong>Pork</strong></a></p>

<p>jst was awesome enough to list some interfaces that need some outparamdelling. The list is <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:DeCOMtamination">here</a> (in the content/ section). This lead me to spent some time making outparamdel&#8217;s output prettier. There are still some improvements to be made, and I will be making them in the near future. However if someone is interested in refactoring of this kind land in the near future, they could easily complete outparamdel&#8217;s work with some clever scripting and a bit of manual labour. Sure beats doing the entire thing manually. From outparamdel&#8217;s perspective last 10% appear to be slightly painful and might take some time.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/nsinodeinfomanager_getnodeinfo.diff">patch</a> that takes about 30seconds to produce.</p>

<p>Another exciting aspect of this is that a certain emacs wizard has confirmed that it would be possible to feed emacs such a patch file and have it correct indentation for the affected areas only.</p>

<p>I am also very excited that a certain volunteer came forward and decided to start improving some of the stomach-turning areas of Pork. Hopefully in the near future we&#8217;ll modernize the C++ a little bit and a user&#8217;s first reaction wont be: &#8220;What the hell, why can&#8217;t I do &#8216;using namespace std;&#8217;&#8221;.</p>

<p>To this end I have filed a bug to write a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=441870">renamer tool</a> so we can dogfood renaming of unfortunately named pieces of code.</p>

<p><strong>OSCON</strong></p>

<p>The plan is to have some sort of a minisession on our static analysis efforts at Mozilla. So if you are attending OSCON and are interested in doing exciting things to depressingly large amounts of code, drop me a line.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear lazyweb,</p>

<p>Please explain to me why the following code works the way it does. From looking at the following code and stringstream::str(), stringstream::str(string) docs the behavior of the following code does not make sense to me.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#include &lt;sstream&gt;
</span><span class='line'>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>using namespace std;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char**) { stringstream ss(&#8220;foo&#8221;); cout &lt;&lt; ss.str() &lt;&lt; endl; ss &lt;&lt; &#8220;bar&#8221;; cout &lt;&lt; ss.str() &lt;&lt; endl; ss &lt;&lt; &#8220;more&#8221;; cout &lt;&lt; ss.str() &lt;&lt; endl; }</p>

<p>Why is doing &lt;&lt; after str(string) causing this stringstream to loose the initialization string? What possible API usecase would justify such behavior?</p>

<p>For the curious, output is:</p>

<p>foo bar barmore</p>

<p>It seems that the only sensible way to use stringstream is to do ss.str(&#8220;&#8221;) unless you want to have your initial data reset for no reason. In that case why add a weird method overload instead of a .reset() method.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Note that stringstream ss(&#8220;foo&#8221;) is equivalent to stringstream ss; ss.str(&#8220;foo&#8221;);</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Pork"><strong>Pork</strong></a></p>

<p>I planned to release Pork 1.0 for a while now. The tools work great, even if all the love is going to the GCC-based toolchain. However, after hearing grumpy comments from a certain coworker about the uglyness of the oink build system it dawned on me that it&#8217;s rather mean to release such a mess and call it 1.0.</p>

<p>So I think I&#8217;ll release Pork 0.9 in the current state, so I can focus on near term GCC toolchain work. Pork in the current form means <a href="http://danielwilkerson.com/oink/">oink stack</a> + my refactoring tools + changes to elsa and other libs to support C/C++ refactoring needs.</p>

<p>This will be followed up by Pork 1.0. 1.0 will involve changes to the build system to get rid of oink(we only use the oink build system and rarely use oink API). To put this another way: I don&#8217;t expect any functionality changes between 0.9 and 1.0 other than an improved build system to make it easier to get started with writing new tools.</p>

<p><strong>Pork - Future</strong></p>

<p>I am pretty happy with Pork as it is. I think we&#8217;ve taken Elsa as far as it&#8217;ll let us go. The only realistic improvement on the Pork side may be to have Dehydra generate a JS binding to Elsa&#8217;s extensive AST to make rewriting stuff easier. However, I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s worth the effort nor that a C++ AST will reflect into JavaScript as well as GCC GIMPLE.</p>

<p><em>Preprocessing</em></p>

<p>On the other hand, something needs to be done about the main ingradient that makes Pork tick: MCPP. MCPP does a lovely job of annotating what the C preprocessor is doing, but configuring GCC to use a foreign preprocessor is a giant hassle and making sure it works correctly is troublesome. At the GCC summit, <a href="http://tromey.com/blog/">Tom</a> gave me an idea on how similar functionality can be added to GCC directly by extending the include backtrace with macro expansions. Not only would such integration simplify Pork setup and increase Pork&#8217;s operating speed, but it is also a clean way to expose preprocessor constructs to the AST presented in De/Treehydra. It should allow for more preprocessor awareness directly in analysis stage of refactoring instead of only in the final rewriting stage as is currently done. As a side-effect, GCC would gain better error messages too.</p>

<p>So while this isn&#8217;t going to affect Pork directly, it will simplify the lives of Pork users while opening new analysis frontiers. Even though I hate working on preprocessor stuff, I think this work will need to happen sometime in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="Dehydra">The Hydras</a></p>

<p>Dehydra 0.9 has been out for a while, I planned to release 1.0 soon after unless there are major flaws discovered in the API. The situation changed at the GCC summit. The fact that FSF reversed their stance on GCC plugins means that we should be concentrating on getting the plugin stuff reviewed.</p>

<p>So in the near term I&#8217;m forward porting the plugin stuff to trunk GCC, then I&#8217;ll be generalize the plugin API to suit at least one other GCC plugin user that we met with at the summit. The downside is that I don&#8217;t want to release Dehydra 1.0 and immediately break the plugin API. The upside is that the new API should be more general and more minimalistic and will likely be close to what will eventually become an official plugin API.</p>

<p><em>Summary</em>: In my mind Dehydra and Pork are 1.0 quality, but I want to future-proof them a little bit before calling them 1.0.</p>

<p>The big news is that FSF is working on license changes to allow GPL-only GCC plugins. I&#8217;m looking forward to having our work be compatible with future GCC without any patching.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we&#8217;ll be having a meeting with users of other plugin frameworks to have an initial discussion on a common API. I&#8217;m working on forward porting my patches, so they can start getting reviewed ahead of license changes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am finally happy enough with Dehydra API and functionality to release 0.9. <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Dehydra">Dehydra</a> is basically feature complete, the main reason I&#8217;m not calling it 1.0 is in case there are outstanding API bugs.</p>

<p>I believe Dehydra is the first useful open source static analysis tool. I hope to see projects outside of Mozilla benefitting from it too.</p>

<p>I would love to see someone package this up for various Linux distributions. You can grab there release <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/dehydra/dehydra-0.9.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note, this release also features as a preview release of <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Treehydra">Treehydra</a>. Most of the development lately has been focused on improving Treehydra and building analyses on top of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After writing a ton of <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Dehydra_Manual">docs</a> and working through other <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Dehydra">Dehydra</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423898">0.9 blockers</a>, I decided to cool off by doing some actual analyses. Before I get to that, I&#8217;d like to say that the last big task is to setup a buildbot for Dehydra on Linux/OSX. Thanks to yet another awesome contribution from Vlad, that&#8217;s <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430321">mostly done</a>.</p>

<p>So I got working on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=421934">GC-safety static analysis</a>. Originally we tried to define a complete spec before writing a single line of code. That turned to be a bad idea and resulted in a spec full of bugs. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=432915">This time</a> we are defining the analysis incrementally and as a surprise reward, it already caught <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=435546">a bug</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pushing and Popping Our Way</strong></p>

<p>SpiderMonkey has a lot of complex code doing applying Push/Pop-like operations on variables in a function-local manner. Examples of functions that this analysis would look at are: JS_PUSH_TEMP_ROOT/JS_POP_TEMP_ROOT and JS_LOCK/JS_UNLOCK. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=432915">bug</a> for more. Essentially, this will help with &#8220;code must flow through here&#8221; comments on &#8220;out:&#8221; goto labels that inhabit the SpiderMonkey source.</p>

<p>This is an example of control-flow-sensitive analysis. It impossible without a compiler-like view of the code that <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Treehydra">Treehydra</a> provides. It also helps to have a scalable algorithm to iterate the CFG. Luckily, David Mandelin wrote such a beast by implementing <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs711/2005fa/papers/dls-pldi02.pdf">ESP</a> for his <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=420933">outparam analysis</a>. David factored-out the ESP analysis and made it available for reuse. See esp_lock.js in the <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/dehydra-gcc/index.cgi/file/8f6914b2aaf9/test/">test suite</a> for an example of how to write control-flow sensitive analyses. locks_valid<em>.cc and locks_bad</em>.cc illustrate the code patterns that can be scanned for.</p>

<p>So if you know of any further push/pop patterns in the rest of Moz that can be checked in this manner, leave a comment.</p>

<p>PS. This is yet another account of Treehydra rocking the static analysis world. Exposing the slightly scary, but awesome GCC gutts via JavaScript allows one to perform precise static analyses in a civilized manner. What could be more fun?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I work on static analysis by lamp-light and proudly cycle wearing Firefox imagery by daylight. Today I was pleased to discover that the flyer for the <a href="http://www.portlandcentury.com/">Portland Century</a> ride now prominently features the Firefox logo in one of the 4 photos. It&#8217;s also in the scrolling thing on the website =D</p>

<p>This picture was taken on one ride with the most firefox fans ever. On parts of the course, it felt like every 5 minutes someone was volunteering info on how awesome firefox is.</p>
