  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>New Tool: Prcheck - PRBool&#8217;s best friend </strong></p>

<p>Mozilla has a number boolean types and most of them are a form of an int. People expect them to behave like a bool, but since they can be assigned more than 1 value for true, this assumption can lead to bugs. Prcheck will mandate that prbools can only be assigned 1 or 0. Typically static checkers output errors, but prcheck outputs errors &amp; fixes for them in diff format so they can be fixed automatically. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=266048">this bug</a> for more info. I think the tool is almost complete. Hopefully, once the MCPP issues described below are addressed, I&#8217;ll have one giant patch to eliminate this problem.</p>

<p><strong>MCPP Teething Troubles</strong></p>

<p>Even in the open-source world there are some problems with vendor monoculture. For example we a single vendor providing the C++ compiler and one C preprocessor that is widely used. Even though MCPP is a portable preprocessor that can plug into multiple compilers, it still chokes on some GCCisms. Things are slowly changing and new open source compilers are on the horizon: I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>Additionally, since Mozilla is one of the largest projects to be preprocessed with MCPP, we found some scalability bugs in MCPP. The MCPP maintainer addressed those.</p>

<p><strong>Elsa Backend Source Location Work - Works Well?</strong></p>

<p>I am amazed, but hack &amp; slash approach to adding end-of-ast-node info to elkhound still seems to work correctly! It mostly required consulting wikipedia on LR &amp; GLR parsing algorithms to understand how to modify the data structures used in elkhound. I love the combination of Wikipedia and pretty &amp; easy to modify source code.</p>

<p>The preprocessor undo-log appears to function exactly as intended too. That combined with the end-of-ast-node info means that I finally have the ability to easily cut&#8217;n&#8217;paste code to move it around programmatically. It basically makes the C/C++ pretty printer in oink obsolete for my purposes. This is cool because now I can output prettier source code AND rely on less oink C++ code to do so (ie no need to call the pretty printer[s]), so more refactoring tools could be written in higher level languages such as OCaml or JavaScript in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Publishing My Oink Mods</strong></p>

<p>I have been sending people tarballs on request, due to not being able to integrate my changes into the upstream svn repository. I tried a few svn2hg tools, but they didn&#8217;t work very well. <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/hgsvn/">hgsvn</a> is good enough to work for OpenJDK, so it might work for me. I&#8217;ll try to publish an hg repository of my work within the next week or two.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry for not doing this earlier, but it&#8217;s extremely time consuming to switch gears from coding oink stuff to trying to package it, especially due to all of the politics involved. Hopefully once the repository is easier to work with I&#8217;ll have more people sharing the oink worldload with me. Now that dust settled and the major missing pieces are either implemented or decided upon, a lot of exciting possibilities opened up.</p>

<p><strong>libgcc</strong></p>

<p>Another day, another piece of preprocessor trivia. Turned out there was an alternative to MCPP that I could have used: gcc&#8217;s libcpp. It is common knowledge that gcc uses an integrated preprocessor. It is not so well known that the preprocessor is factored out into what appears to be a mostly standalone library inside of gcc called libgcc. Google barely knows about it and there are no docs or other webpages pointing to it, so i missed it in my search.</p>

<p>This could be a useful project, take libcpp turn it back into a standalone preprocessor and add the cpp undo log comments to it. The only downside of libgcc is that it is GPL which would normally be a pain for BSD-licensed projects, but by turning it back into a standalone tool there is no linking to to worry about.</p>

<p>So if anyone finds implementing the macro-undo log with libgcc interesting, please feel free to do so :)</p>

<p><strong>Random Rant on Parallels vs VMWare Fusion vs BootCamp vs 64bit Linux</strong></p>

<p>I installed 64bit ubuntu on my MBP. Compilers &amp; other tools are ridiculously fast when running linux natively on core2duo. Due to some performance bugs that I can&#8217;t track down (shark isn&#8217;t working for and recently OSX&#8217;s gdb stopped working too) oink runs much faster on the linux side of the MBP. If any mac people want to profile oink on OSX, that&#8217;d be awesome. However OSX has some nice things (such as a display driver that works well and good battery life). I wish ati wasn&#8217;t such a pain with releasing specs for their cards so linux could support them properly. I hope the recent reverse engineered driver work stabilizes soon. So I figured it would be nice to access &amp; work on the linux partition from within OSX.</p>

<p>I was pretty excited when I heard that Parallels 3 supports BootCamp. Problem was that nothing could see the bootcamp linux install. Turned the problem was caused because I used fdisk + refit to do the partitioning and turned on the bootable flag. To fix this I turned off the bootable flag on the linux partition using parted(which can sync the gpt partition table!) .</p>

<p>Then I realized that Parallels has very slow disk access AND doesn&#8217;t do 64bit and doesn&#8217;t appear to support SMP.</p>

<p>VMWare Fusion on the other hand supports bootcamp &amp; 64bit &amp; smp and appears to have much faster IO. However it lacks UI for accessing a linux bootcamp install or documentation. So here is the secret recipe to save time for others in my situation:</p>

<p>1) Create a vmware disk for the bootcamp partition using vmware-rawdiskCreator in /Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion.</p>

<p>2) Create a new machine, point at the file created in 1.</p>

<p>Fusion&#8217;s performance is remarkable. Oink runs almost as fast as it does natively. Plus VMWare support the VMI interface in Linux which combined with a tickless kernel should make the virtualizing overhead minimal. Too bad Linux doesn&#8217;t have these features yet for amd64.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Back to Real Life</strong></p>

<p>Just over a month ago I ran into <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/2007/05/11/cpp-strikes-back/">this problem</a>. Before last month I hoped to never have to work on the C preprocessor or a parser generator. So much for that plan. Now my head is full of CPP-expansion-related trivia.</p>

<p>After a month of design and implementing changes to mcpp, elsa, elkhound and oink I can finally move on. During the last week all of the pieces of the puzzle finally came together ( without any nasty surprises other than bugs). Now I can go back to solving real problems.</p>

<p><strong>Upcoming Features</strong></p>

<p>Benefits of having CPP support don&#8217;t stop at actually being able to rewrite code. Now that the Oink C++ parser is aware of the C preprocessor, it should be possible to refactor C++ almost as easily as Java. Here are some cool things that are possible now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nicer UI. Exact source position info allows for eclipse-style context menus for renaming &amp; other refactorings in lxr (or other online code browsers).</li>
<li>Richer type system. It should be possible to detect macro constants. Tools will be able to tell the difference between a prnull and 0. Should also be able to detect and maintain NSRESULT and other macros used for declarations.</li>
<li>Macro refactoring. Now it&#8217;s possible to write a tool to automate the process of converting function-like macro calls to actual function calls. For example, PR_MAX could be converted into std::max calls with all of the accompanying casts to ensure that the resulting C++ is correct.</li>
<li>Other nasty tricks like rewriting code within macro declarations.
I&#8217;m not sure how much of these features I will work on, but they are relatively easy to implement now.</li>
</ul>


<p>I plan to write a minimalistic successor to squash and develop more aggressive refactorings than renames.</p>

<p>Additionally, I will continue pushing above changes upstream and trying to facilitate a more open oink development community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is incredibly exciting: I believe that I finally solved the messy and mind-numbingly boring CPP/C++ integration problem! Having code displaced or generated due to CPP-expansion should no longer be a fatal problem for <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Squash">Squash</a>. I believe macro-expansion is (or was) the single biggest problem between me and large-scale automated refactoring of the Mozilla codebase.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s even more exciting is that I think my solution is both incredibly simple to implement and more general than prior work. Most other tools combine the CPP expansion &amp; C parsing into a single step and then integrate (or should I say violently shove?) CPP constructs into the AST. This results in complete lack of separation between preprocessing and program analysis. For example, due to this tight coupling existing solutions were useless to me because the fancy CPP logic could not be separated from the C parser. I would also have a hard time submitting a more convoluted C++ parser upstream to the Elsa maintainer.</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong></p>

<p>There are three parts to my solution:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Critical component</em>. A CPP expansion undo-log injected during CPP-expansion by a modified C preprocessor (upcoming version of MCPP). The statements are wrapped in C comments such that the preprocessed result can be parsed by any C/C++/etc parser or compiler. Implementation-wise this is the hardest part since MCPP(as most other C proprocessors) was never designed it keep track of macro expansion info.</li>
<li>A small modification to the Elsa lexer to parse the undo-log and set it aside in a separate data structure.</li>
<li><em>Tricky</em>. A function that utilizes the cpp undo-log to map the preprocessed source locations to the unpreprocessed ones. This is a a ridiculously simple solution to a tricky design problem of how to efficiently advertise the fact that every AST node has at least 2 different source positions (pre expansion, post expansion &amp; a stack of positions resulting from expanding nested macros).
The MCPP maintainer is almost done with 1. I have a prototype implementation of 2 &amp; 3 weighing in at less than 500lines. Now that the design phase is complete, the amount of changes to Elsa is trivial, so I should be done with those real soon now.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>

<p>Now I need to modify Elsa to retain more precise source locations. This includes adding end-of-ast-node-location and adding positions to nodes(such as expressions) that don&#8217;t even have a start position at the moment. This combined with cpp-undo-log enhanced precise positions should allow for code rewrites to retain as much original source code as possible. This reduces the amount of ugly machine-generated code and results in better correctness (existing code is likely to work).</p>

<p><strong>CPP Undo-log Example</strong></p>

<p>The undo-log took a couple of tries to get right. Now macro-parameters have a notion of scope and sensible names. The following example features macro-induced column displacement and macro-expansion causing line shrinkage.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<p>Preprocessed version</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>/*mNULL 1:8-1:15*/
</span><span class='line'>/*mFOO 2:8-2:23*/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>int i = /<em><NULL 3:8-3:12*/0L/*></em>/; # 3 &#8220;testcase4.c&#8221; int j; int k = /<em><FOO 4:8-6:3*//*!FOO#0-0 5:0-5:13*//*!FOO#0-1 6:1-6:2*//*<FOO#0-0*//*<FOO*//*!FOO#1-0*//*!FOO#1-1*//*<FOO#1-0*//*<NULL*/0L/*></em>//<em>></em>/ + /<em>&lt;FOO#1-1</em>/1/<em>></em>//<em>></em>//<em>></em>/ + /<em>&lt;FOO#0-1</em>/2/<em>></em>//<em>></em>/;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It took a lot to arrive at such a simple solution. I expect that all of my work is likely to end up upstream in BSD-licensed projects: MCPP &amp; and Elsa/Oink. I sincerely hope that other people will be able to build on it for their CPP-infested analysis needs and avoid the unbearable mind-numbing discomfort associated with making CPP play along.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Existing Work</strong></p>

<p>All of existing work is based on basic C parsers so it can&#8217;t be directly applied to C++.</p>

<p>I found out that someone did a PhD on refactoring C code resulting in the <a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/garrido/www/CRefactory.html">CRefactory</a>(down atm) project. Looks like reversing the C preprocessor was by far the hardest task to address. Languages consisting of stacked lexical syntaxes (like OCaml &amp; camlp4) or preprocessorless ones like Java don&#8217;t even have this problem.</p>

<p>A way to tackle the problem is to violently shove the some of the preprocessor markup into the C AST. Unfortunately this is an incredibly hard task because CPP is purely lexical and works at the token level, whereas the C compilers works with higher level AST syntax trees. Combining the two can result in an ambiguous grammar which is useless for refactoring.</p>

<p>CRefactory integrates CPP into the AST where possible, it even handles some CPP conditionals. The author&#8217;s argument is that every CPP conditional represents a separate configuration and processing one configuration at a time will result in a combinatorial explosion of configurations to process thus conditionals must be integrated into the AST.</p>

<p>However, CPP-in-AST solution is error prone and has issues scaling to large projects. Besides I think processing every configuration within the AST is still potentially a combinatorial explosion, the major benefit being that one can eliminate unfeasible conditionals if they cause syntax errors. This conditional elimination would be incredibly slow for C++. I also don&#8217;t believe that this would be enough to solve Mozilla&#8217;s conditionals since most of the troublesome macros are platform specific and would have dependencies on the system headers. Having said that, I appreciate seeing people prove that with enough effort even seemingly impossible tasks can be accomplished.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~billm/astec-fse.pdf">paper</a> on ASTEC presents another solution which involves translating [lexical] CPP constructs into a CPP-like AST-based language. This works great in theory, but the translation process is only semi-automatic and requires a lot of hand-holding. I have mixed feeling about this approach. A simpler intermediate language is an excellent thing but as soon as it becomes &#8220;CPP sux, so I invented this better language: use it&#8221; the world gains yet another troublesome programming language.</p>

<p><strong>My Approach</strong></p>

<p>It took me a few weeks to figure out how to tackle the CPP problem in squash. I think I have a solution that will work real soon(TM).</p>

<p>I like to avoid solving unsolvable problems and stick with works-for-me approach. Thus I probably wont make squash aware of CPP conditionals. My existing approach of combining output of running squash on Mac/Linux(and Windows in the future) should take care of 99% of cases in Mozilla. The rest will be flagged by a compiler and will be trivial to fix by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Macro Expansion</strong></p>

<p>I also don&#8217;t see the benefit of a partially integrated CPP within the C++ AST. Instead I am modifying MCPP to log the macro expansions with special markup enclosed in comments. Afterwards I plan to modify elsa to parse the macro-expansion log and modify the position tags on AST nodes accordingly. Then I&#8217;ll be able to do cool things like &#8220;cut out the piece of code that was parsed as 0&#8221; which will reference the source locations, figure out that 0 was a result of macro expansion and return &#8220;NULL&#8221;. Or when I try to rewrite a member in PR_MAX(something->GetPresContext()->foo, 0), the code will know that the the two GetPresContext() calls in the AST correspond to the same code fragment.</p>

<p>Besides, isn&#8217;t this marked-up code pretty?</p>

<p><strong>CONCAT(</strong>, boo) int <strong>MATHDECL_1( </strong>CONCAT(<em>_, lgamma),</em>r); <strong>Code</strong></p>

<p>The MCPP maintainer is absolutely awesome work with. MCPP needs to be modified to preserve horizontal whitespace(which preprocessors don&#8217;t do) and to provide the above expansion info. He volunteered to do a lot of the MCPP modifications for me and has been a lot of help in guiding me through his code.</p>

<p>At this point looks like we&#8217;ll be able to integrate this work into the MCPP trunk. This is great news because to the best of my knowledge all of the other C refactoring tools either use a bitrotting fork of some C preprocessor or reimplement a yet another buggy version of CPP resulting in a lot of collectively wasted effort.</p>

<p>I hope to have this working in squash within two weeks so I can finish the outparam rewrite and hopefully rid squash of a large portion of code that details with the non-deterministic source positions due to macro expansion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Positive</strong></p>

<p>Since the last blog post, I have been investigating on how to teach elsa about the C preprocessor. Overall, I am really happy that <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/">MCPP</a> exists and is actively maintained. Preprocessed source code may not be invertible into the original form, but at least it can be undone enough for refactoring purposes.</p>

<p>Looks like I should be able to preprocess the source code, and while at it record macro expansion information and then have elsa fed with a somewhat xml-escue data structure.</p>

<p>The way I see it, a line of code like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>foo = PR_MAX(boo(), nsnull)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which expands into</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>foo =  boo() &gt; 0 ? boo() : 0;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will get fed to elsa as something like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;fragment&gt;foo = &lt;macro id=somemacro_instance&gt;PR_MAX(boo(), nsnull)&lt;/macro&gt;;&lt;/fragment&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where somemacro_instance is defined as</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;fragment&gt;&lt;fragment ref=some_fragment/&gt; &gt; 0 ? &lt;fragment ref=some_fragment/&gt; : &lt;macro id=some_staticmacro&gt;0&lt;/macro&gt;&lt;/fragment&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where some_staticmacro is defined as</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;fragment&gt;0&lt;/fragment&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I think this is a cute scheme because fragments are basically regions of source-code. This is exciting because once a macro is used in the code, the text fragment that defines the macro can be parsed as C++ and rewritten accordingly. Obviously, this wouldn&#8217;t be the default behavior.</p>

<p>If you see a fatal flow in the above model, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>

<p>My main reason for adding preprocessor support to elsa is to obtain precise source locations from elsa. Ironically, MCPP &#8220;compresses&#8221; whitespace, so column information is basically thrown out of the window. Means I&#8217;ll have to do some extensive culling of the compression code (which is everywhere).</p>

<p>Another fun issue is that the general structure of MCPP encourages the &#8220;lots of global variables and defines&#8221; mode of programming. It also uses strings-as-a-data-structure pattern which may make me give up on the fancy onion-peel model I described above and instead have mcpp generate preprocessed code along with an &#8220;undo&#8221; type log.</p>

<p>MCPP is also a bit on the slow side compared to GCC, but I&#8217;ll trade a second or two slowdown per file for never having to cry due to CPP again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have gotten used to dodging CPP-expansion issues by fudging column &amp; line information until the position info in squash mostly matches the source positions in the original source code. That sufficed for rewriting declarations, but I have finally hit a brick wall.</p>

<p><strong>CPP Fun</strong></p>

<p>I got as far with call-site outparam rewriting as <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/outparams.May11.diff">this patch</a>. It demonstrates an interesting flaw.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>@@ -8297,1 +8297,1 @@
</span><span class='line'>-  GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, nsnull, &insertionPoint, &multiple);
</span><span class='line'>+  insertionPoint = GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, &insertionPoint, &multiple);
</span><span class='line'>@@ -8346,1 +8346,1 @@
</span><span class='line'>-          GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, child, &insertionPoint);
</span><span class='line'>+          insertionPoint = GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, child);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Due to macro expansion, nsnull contracts to 0 such that the .i file has &amp;insertionpoint positioned right in the middle of nsnull (in the .cpp file). So when squash trims the param including the surrounding commas, it ends up removing the wrong parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Elsa Limitation</strong></p>

<p>I have mentioned lack of end-of-ast-node position information in Elsa. It also lacks start-of-ast-node information for most expressions. This makes selectively rewriting source code rather difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>

<p>Instead of fighting an uphill fudging battle against CPP, I am going to have to suspend outparam rewriting yet again to work on better position information and integrating a preprocessor into elsa. This is unfortunate because I was looking forward to finally doing something more sophisticated than renames. Now my elsa fork is going to grow even bigger before I get commit access.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Automatic code rewriting business can be a little depressing sometimes. I tend to run into funny issues caused by CPP, oink limitations or just unpleasant-to-rewrite parts of C++. After banging my head against the wall due to all these issues I finally arrived at a workable approach for the easy part of the outparam rewrite.</p>

<p>Currently I have a dehydra script that finds all non-virtual getters that return either NS_OK or <em>NS_SOMETHING_IS_WRONG</em>. The script then outputs data for squash to base the rewrites on. Then squash takes over.</p>

<p>In order to preserve sanity, pretty-printing is not used at all for rewriting the getter functions. This way one doesn&#8217;t have to worry about oink generating invalid C++ and the output is much more aesthetically pleasing. Instead, squash finds interesting expressions in the .i file. Then it extracts the corresponding strings from .h/.cpp files. The strings are used to fudge the position information obtained from the .i file to vaguely correspond to the original source files. After various C++ string-foo, squash produces a promising looking patch like <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/outparams.May10.diff">this</a>.</p>

<p>This also relies on a fair amount of semantic information provided by elsa/oink. For example when removing a parameter, squash inserts a local variable with the same name and then removes all of the derefences of the old parameter. Since there could be multiple variables with the same name, squash relies on elsa&#8217;s variable resolution.</p>

<p>I think squash is now 50% feature complete with respect to outparam stuff. The other 50% is the hard part of rewriting all of the call-sites. I&#8217;m not counting easy parts like wrapping the return type in already_AddRefed&lt;>, eliminating redundant assignments in the getter or removing the error variable once it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>This still doesn&#8217;t add the already_AddRefed or other important attributes, but that should be easy. The result looks simple, but getting squash from working with a testcase to an actual source file was a little on the painful side.</p>

<p>After my experience with renaming I have realized that squash should avoid the C++ pretty printer for now. Thus the result is produced in a verbose AST-sensitive regexp-like way. However figuring out where things start and end is incredibly painful due to the presence of the preprocessor.</p>

<p>My plan is to get squash rewriting some basic Mozilla code the painful way and then I use what I learned to integrate <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/">mcpp</a> along with the much coveted end-of-ast-node info into elsa.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript is an AST&#8217;s Best Friend </strong></p>

<p>Until recently I have been doing a lot of work with dehydra. Now that it is feature-complete I am back to working on squash fulltime and I miss JavaScript already. JS is much better suited for messing about with Abstract Syntax Trees. It is so nice to be able to print out any data structure, create new ones without modifying a billion files and the lack of C++ compile/linking delay is nice too. It&#8217;s amazing how much simpler it is to analyze functions for out-param rewriting in JS compared to checking for simpler patterns in C++. I am seriously excited about Tamarin/ES4 and the productivity boost that it will provide.</p>

<p>I wonder whether a complete JS binding for Elsa would be a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Emacs</strong></p>

<p>Switching to a Mac finally made me switch to Emacs. I could not find any other editors that would be support the workflow I was used to with SciTE or Kate. Other than absolutely hating the majoring of Emacs shortcuts (who&#8217;s idea was Ctrl-^ and the crazy undo/redo) I love the editor for the amazing term mode. It&#8217;s a little buggy in the current version, but the CVS version is good enough to comfortably run vim in it for quick edits :). It&#8217;s so nice to keep all of my terminals and code in the same window. I am dreaming of the day when Emacs will undergo the Mozilla->Firefox-like modernization.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Automated Analyses and Rewrites</strong></p>

<p>Dehydra and Squash are now mature enough to assist with mundane tasks like renames and various kinds of tedious code inspection. If you ever suspect that part of the Mozilla hacking you are doing could be done by a tool, contact me to see if I have a suitable tool for you.</p>

<p>Also, these tools are in no way limited to working with Mozilla source code. I would be happy to see people use them for other projects too.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term Plans</strong></p>

<p>For the next week or two I plan to focus on out-parameter rewriting and the Mozilla-wide C++ callgraph.</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla-wide Callgraph</strong> This is proving to be a little painful. Things work for basic test-cases, but I am running into scalability issues with Mozilla (as expected). My current approach of serializing everything into a giant JSON graph blows the 32bit address space after a few hundred files. Even doing a Mozilla-wide inheritance graph causes out of memory errors, but that runs almost to competition. The best solution to this will be to break up the graph into as many smaller JSON files as possible and only load ones that are absolutely required into memory.</p>

<p>The callgraph will be a useful starting point for many other useful analyses (dead code one is going to be lots of fun) and it&#8217;s a good test of dehydra&#8217;s scalability, but I have suspended work on it for a few days to focus on more productive tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Out-parameter Rewriting</strong></p>

<p>Due to XPCOM, Mozilla getters typically return an error code and a value via an out parameter. This requires checking the error code and likely propagating it at the callsite.</p>

<p>For many places in the code there are performance and aesthetical reasons to stop using error codes. Brendan talks discusses some reasons <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/10/mozilla_2.html">here</a>. This would be cool stuff, but switching to exceptions isn&#8217;t going to happen right away. However, I can already start working on my tools to assist with simpler cases (like <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;q=+nsBidiPresUtils::GetBidiEngine+show:kW5gzhxHJvU:iRn_dfI9xJY:Y5Gdp6b4NgE&amp;sa=N&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=rc&amp;cs_p=http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.7a/src/mozilla-source-1.7a.tar.bz2&amp;cs_f=mozilla/layout/base/src/nsBidiPresUtils.cpp#a0">nsBidiPresUtils::GetBidiEngine</a>?). I&#8217;m focusing on getters that return NS_OK/(some error) and a value and rewriting them to return NULL on error and non-NULL on success. This could be ready in time for Firefox 3. Once I&#8217;m done with the tool, I&#8217;ll just need someone to help me figure which functions are ok to simplify like that.</p>

<p>I suspended work on out-param rewriting <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/2007/01/11/squash-progress-and-plans/">some time ago</a>. It was proving to be too complicated to do within squash. Now that I can use dehydra to verify the control flow graph, things are a lot simpler. Current plan is to have the <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/outparams.js">dehydra script</a> produce a list of candidates for out-param surgery and have squash consume that list and produce the appropriate patches. Currently, the script works for some very simple cases and I am working on the squash side.</p>

<p><strong>Smaller Tasks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sayrer&#8217;s uninitialized member analysis: added more complete constructor support to dehyra, wrote a <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/member-init.js">sample script</a> to get sayrer started. Fixed dehydra&#8217;s 64bit support. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378763">Bug 378763</a></li>
<li>Made some squash-generated patches for bz, helped me find a bug in squash. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378780">Bug 378780</a></li>
<li>Pushing squash upstream into oink. This is time consuming because it is a combination of legal and many minor technical issues. Dehydra will follow later.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last attempt at visualizing the Mozilla class hierarchy ended up being way too slow to be useful. So I based my second attempt on using a different <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/jscript/graphic_javascript_tree.asp">tree layout</a>. After quite a few scalability optimizations, the graphing performance is now bearable.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/classbrowser/classbrowser.html">class browser</a> uses the canvas tag to draw the pretty boxes &amp; lines and links back into lxr. The class browser consumes a JSON file produced by running DeHydra on the layout/ directory. I am happy that I am finally able to examine gigantic code graphs interactively thanks to the <canvas> tag.</p>

<p>In the near future I hope to produce a few different kinds of complete graphs of the entire Firefox codebase. The idea is to have them generated nightly. Then that if someone has a general question about the Firefox codebase, it could be expressed as JavaScript within an interactive console in the browser. The answer would be either be graphed or returned as a JSON object.</p>
