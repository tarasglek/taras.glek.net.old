  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/10/12/rewriting-tools-for-mozilla-2-moving-forward-as-planned/">few weeks</a> ago I convinced myself that is possible to rewrite Mozilla to avoid COMPtrs on the stack. Since then I&#8217;ve changed my mind a few times and felt like I may not be able to get this rewrite working. However, after three or four false starts, I finally managed to work out a metal model of the stack nsCOMPtr usage. With a combination of automatic blacklisting of tricky code, manual demacroing and lots of help from <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/">Benjamin</a> I got the generated 3.2MB patch to compile.</p>

<p>I am sure that there are lots of bugs to be found still, but at least we&#8217;ve discovered the pattern that the code follows. I am also sure that there are lots of unpleasant surprises to be discovered and dealt with in the near future.</p>

<p>The bright side is that the result of these rewrites we should get a less buggy codebase that is easier to work on, more efficient and compiles to smaller binaries. My other big wish is to significantly reduce the amount of C++ magic in the codebase.</p>

<p>I am happy that garburator works as it means I can go back to playing <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/category/outparamdel/">outparamdel</a>. Hopefully, once garburator+outparamdel are applied on all possible methods we&#8217;ll end up with relatively nice looking C++ code and a healthy performance boost.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m having a very painful time rewriting Mozilla source code to switch it to garbage collection. So I took a little break to think about Myk&#8217;s <a href="http://www.melez.com/mykzilla/2007/10/automated-js-code-rewriting.html">JavaScript rewriting idea</a>.Then I found excellent info on <a href="http://siliconforks.com/doc/parsing-javascript-with-spidermonkey/">parsing JS</a> with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey</a>. The downside to SpiderMonkey is that it is in C and thus hard to reuse, the upside is that will be able to parse all valid JavaScript.</p>

<p>I think I shall find some free time to prototype a little tool to take a .js file and produce a JSON representation of it such that one could write transformation passes in JavaScript. This will be useful as it will complete DeHydra by enabling it to process JS in addition to C++ and it will save a lot of time for various JavaScript refactorings.</p>

<p>I expect developing a JS refactoring tool to be relatively trivial compared to refactoring C++ as there is no source-code mangling going on due to lack of preprocessing (but JS is dynamic and can be embedded in various document types, so that could complicate things). Perhaps it would even be of use to mozpad people.</p>

<p>Looking forward to playing more with this idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>In the Beginning There Was a Void</strong></p>

<p>Approximately a year ago, Brendan discussed with me the crazy possibility of rewriting most of the Mozilla code automatically to modernize the codebase. The benefits were huge. Gecko would use the C++ standard library to improve code readability and reducing size, XPCOM would be ripped out of the core to improve performance and decrease footprint, etc.</p>

<p>It seemed like a good idea, but in reality no other giant C++ project has attempted this before so we were not sure of how realistic it was. I spent a year in a <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2007-10-11/dehydra-ftw/">lonely corner</a> of Mozilla trying to materialize the idea.</p>

<p>Brendan &amp; Graydon pointed me to <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/sources/elsa/">elsa</a>, the C++ parser that supposedly could parse Mozilla. However, it turned out that it was only able to parse an old version of Mozilla and rejected the new source. One of the elsa maintainers even tried to convince us to it was not designed for source-to-source transformations and wouldn&#8217;t work that way.</p>

<p>After I patched up elsa and started devising ways to use it for source rewriting I ran into more pain. After a few false starts, I realized that C++ in Mozilla is actually a mix of CPP and C++ and one can not rewrite C++ without dealing with the <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/05/11/cpp-strikes-back/">mess that is macro expansion</a>. <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/">MCPP</a> was pointed out to me as a good starting point for hacking on a preprocessor. So I <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/06/12/undoing-cpp-expansion-in-3-simple-steps.-say-hello-to-easier-c-rewriting./">designed</a> an inline log for macro expansion. To my surprise the maintainer of MCPP, Kiyoshi MATSUI, volunteered to implement the spec and thus saved me from a world of pain. (For which I am eternally grateful as I can&#8217;t imagine a more depressing pastime than working on the root of all evil: the C preprocessor).</p>

<p>In parallel with Kiyoshi&#8217;s work I modified <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/">elkhound</a> &amp; elsa to make the C++ parser a lot more suitable for source transformations. I learned about LR &amp; GLR parsing and confirmed my suspicion that I don&#8217;t want to write parser generators for a living.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>All this work finally got us what we discussed last September: a framework for doing lots of <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/XPCOMGC/Stack_Pointers">boring code rewrites</a>.</p>

<p>The first big Moz2 task is <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/XPCOMGC">switching</a> from reference counting to garbage collection. Today, <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/09/12/garburator-another-day-another-rewrite-tool/">garburator</a> produced a <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/garburator/nsgenerichtmlelement.diff">gigantic patch</a> for subset of the content/ module and all of the affected files compiled. Hopefully next week I&#8217;ll have a multi-megabyte patch for the whole of Mozilla that compiles and possibly runs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Prcheck</strong></p>

<p>The trouble with prcheck and the automated <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/06/26/status-report-recent-work/">prbool validation</a> is that one can&#8217;t attach the giant patch it produces to bugzilla and expect it to get committed. So I am spending this week combing through prcheck output  and patch-bombing bugzilla with per-module patches.</p>

<p>I find going through the errors manually to be a lot of fun than I expected. I am finding types of errors that I was not considering when I was writing prcheck. For example, I expected the biggest gains to come at runtime from making all prbool values 0/1, but it seems that most of the cool errors are due to PRBool &amp; PRInt32 resolving to the same type. That results in code mayhem ranging from wrong method overloads being called to method signatures claiming to return PRBool where method bodies act like the function returns nsresults.</p>

<p>The prbool check is just an incredibly minor restriction of the C++ system, yet it resulted in hundreds of errors(almost all of which are typos). In my mind this reinforces the importance of static typing (which C++ doesn&#8217;t do enough of).</p>

<p>The main lesson I learned today is that <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=398624">code</a> doesn&#8217;t have to be correct in order to work correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>

<p>While on vacation in Ukraine I finally got to try out GPRS Internet through my cellphone. Sure EDGE is slow, but the convenience of having internet everywhere I go while traveling is unparalleled. It&#8217;s just too bad that I had to go to a developing country to be able to afford mobile internet. In Canada I would&#8217;ve paid over $750 for the $10 worth of Internet in Ukraine. So I am very excited that governments are starting to regulate mobile pricing. Looks like <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20071004/bs_afp/eutelecommobilesectorregulateconsumer">EU is first</a>. I hope the <a href="http://telus.ca">local</a> <a href="http://www.rogers.com">cellular</a> <a href="http://bell.ca/home/">oligopoly</a> gets a kick to the head soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to be on vacation until September 25th. I started the day by planning out how to do the rewriting tool to implement Benjamin&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/XPCOMGC/Stack_Pointers">spec.</a> I&#8217;ll have to add more position information to elsa to do things properly and that might take a week or two. However, I&#8217;m into instant gratification so I wrote up a hacky prototype that results in a patch <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/garburator.diff">like this.</a></p>

<p>Say hi to garburator, a tool that will assist with the reference counting -> MMgc transition. The tool is less than 100 lines long, so someone could finish the hacky version while I am away. Either that or one could teach elsa to keep detailed position information in declarations and identifier names and clean up the postvisitS_decl() method in garburator.</p>

<time datetime="2007-09-10T11:26:36-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 10<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an update on the ongoing <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:DeCOMtamination">deCOMtamination</a> work from the automated rewriting perspective. I think it&#8217;s pretty exciting that Mozilla is the first large-scale C++ project to attempt automated large scale source code cleanups and optimizations. I think the tools are finally getting mature enough for the job.</p>

<p>The downside is that there isn&#8217;t a published roadmap of what we are planning to achieve with deCOMtamination as we are still in the planning stages. The upside is that there is still time for any interested parties to think up the next great improvement on how things are done, <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/07/13/dehydra-prcheck-squash-in-mercurial/">checkout</a> the refactoring toolchain and either extend an existing tool or implement a new one.</p>

<p>Below is a list of things that I plan to have working in the near future. The idea is to try to implement various optimizations that would be impractical(or impossible?) to do manually and see if they yield the expected performance and code quality benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Outparam Elimination</strong></p>

<p>QueryInterface() and other ok/fail methods have a redundant nsresult value which can be eliminated without changing any logic in the code. The QueryInterface() rewrite is my first serious tree-wide refactoring attempt. QueryInterface() is probably the most well known and frequently-used method within Mozilla. It also one of the most CPP-encumbered methods in the tree, so it made for a good test of my CPP-aware elsa work.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=391275">getting code to compile</a> phase is over. Currently Benjamin is working on getting the modified code to run which requires XPConnect changes, debugging the manually-rewritten macros and verifying that the generated patch is correct.</p>

<p>The next step will be to eliminate local nsresult variables in the callees when they are used to store &amp; check return values of QueryInteface(). This is basically a make-resulting-source-look-prettier optimization.</p>

<p>I hope to measure a speed-up and slight footprint decrease with the new QueryInterface call.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Try Mozilla Without Reference Counting?</strong></p>

<p>In my mind the most exciting part of Moz2 is Tamarin. Few things are cooler than an elegant JIT VM.</p>

<p>Tamarin comes with a modern <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/MMgc">garbage collector</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this rewrite is to aid <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/jorendorff/">Jason</a> and <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/">Benjamin</a> with switching XPCOM from reference counting to garbage collection. This might end up in gigantic patches to rid the stack of nsCOMPtr objects. This might be hard as it will be affecting a lot of code and might reveal more shortcomings in <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/08/30/pork-the-brave-new-world/">my version</a> of elsa and MCPP. <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/XPCOMGC">Details</a> are in the wiki.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Try C++ Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>This is the most ambitious rewrite I know of for Mozilla 2. It&#8217;s similar to step 1 in that the goal is to eliminate outparameters and nsresult error codes, except in this case it would happen for all functions. Brendan <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/02/fresh_xpcom_thinking.html">mentioned</a> this is in his blog.</p>

<p>The idea is that exceptions in Mozilla happen in exceptional circumstances, thus most of the time the return value will be NS_OK and the outparameter will have something valid in it. So we should rewrite all methods that return nsresult to return the outparameter value through the return value and have the errors thrown as exceptions.</p>

<p>In the simplest case this would involve rewriting return statements into throw statements and rewrite callers to use try/catch. Instead of</p>

<p>rv = bla(&amp;outparam)&#8230;if(rv == foo) .. else if(rv == boo) return rv</p>

<p>the code would be</p>

<p>try{ outparam=bla() } catch(foo) {&#8230;} catch(boo) {throw boo}</p>

<p>Note this is still inefficient since the code would be manually unrolling the stack instead of letting the exceptions do that. So the next iteration of the rewrite would get rid of the</p>

<p>catch(boo) {throw boo}</p>

<p>code to streamline the execution path. Ideally this would provide a significant reduction of footprint (due to getting rid of the error propagation code) and provide a speed boost.</p>

<p>However, there are a lot of issues that need to be solved. How to ensure that the C++ code is exception-safe (everything has destructors to do appropriate cleanup)? How to deal with the case of the stack being a mix of platform C, C++, JavaScript, Python, etc? Most runtimes are not aware of C++ exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure Work</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all of the automated refactoring work is about exciting rewrites. Elsa is still tied to the stone-age gcc 3.4 as it can&#8217;t yet process C++ headers from the newer gcc releases due to template complexity.</p>

<p>There is also work that needs to be done to get OSX supported as well as Linux by elsa &amp; mcpp. I think very little work remains there.</p>

<p>Another big issue is getting elsa/mcpp to work on Windows. This may involve teaching elsa about the Microsoft windows flavour of C++ or getting Mozilla to reliably build with mingw and merely teaching elsa about mingw&#8217;s flavour of windows C++.</p>

<p>There is also an issue of maturity. Mozilla is probably the biggest codebase to make use of elsa and mcpp, so there are teething issues to solve. Having said that, the current version of MCPP in svn should be able to compile Mozilla. Elsa can process all of Mozilla with a small patch to two files attached in the QueryInterface() bug.</p>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m doing less and less infrastructure work as time goes by, hopefully the tools will mostly just work from now on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It doesn&#8217;t look like my oink patches are going to reach upstream anytime soon. In fact, in the past year no patches have landed in the oink tree. I think this is unfortunate, but I have my own repository at <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org">http://hg.mozilla.org</a> and will continue working on my fork. So allow me to introduce Pork, the Oink fork. So if anyone has any exciting source location, pretty printing or other elsa improvements, I hope to eventually see those land in pork.</p>

<p>Note, pork is just an informal name for the fork, I am not currently planning to do any source renaming or repository renaming.</p>

<p><strong>Pork: Now in a VMware flavour</strong></p>

<p>bsmedberg pointed out that oink seems a bit intimidating to setup and it would be nice if it came in virtual machine. So I have oink/mcpp/etc packaged up in a virtual machine that can build Mozilla with gcc3.4, run dehydra analyses and produce automated patches. If you want to play with that, post a comment and I&#8217;ll reply with a download link.</p>

<p>A couple of people asked me about some simple code-scans to see for problems and optimization opportunities. Next week I am going to post few simple dehydra recipes on how to look for patterns in the code. It&#8217;s dead simple with JavaScript and some minimal shell knowledge to aggregate the results. The VM should provide a good way to get started.</p>

<p><strong>Outparams: QueryInterface Rewrite Milestone Reached </strong> I finally got Mozilla to compile with the outparam-less qi call. The outparamdel part of that was surprisingly easy and straightforward. I   also learned all kinds of fun details about multiple inheritance and fun ways to construct functions out of macro segments. The next step is to get the code to run. I&#8217;ll also have to look into a few minor MCPP issues that the rewrite uncovered. See QI <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=391275">bug</a> for the gory details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Will Rid Code of Outparams!</strong></p>

<p>I resumed my outparam rewriting work last week. Having fixed the <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/05/11/cpp-strikes-back/">CPP induced</a> architectural limitation that I ran into, it was quite straight-forward to factor out squash&#8217;s rewriting code into a new tool. Unlike squash, outparamdel (creatively named new tool), can rewrite code precisely and reliably. I still don&#8217;t have end-of-ast-node information in every Elsa AST member, but I think I have added position info to enough AST nodes to be able to do most of the Mozilla 2 rewrites.</p>

<p>Last time I was working on this, I was a little unhappy with the amount of code that had to be changed in the callee. I also wasn&#8217;t sure how to handle the complexity of callsites where control flow depends on the error code returned by the callee. This time I chose the path of least resistance.</p>

<p>In the callee two variables replace the out-parameter. The first holds the return value and the second points at the first and is declared in the same way as the out-parameter.</p>

<p>With a little more work one can get of one or even both local variables, but that will require more heuristics.</p>

<p>I also simplified call-site rewriting by wrapping the call to the callee function into a ternary expression when the error code is evaluated.</p>

<p><strong>Problems &amp; Limitations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Code within macros is detected, but not modified. Since macros are something that is easier to modify manually than with a tool, this isn&#8217;t a problem.</li>
<li>Indentation isn&#8217;t updated. I think this is solvable with a few more heuristics in the patcher.</li>
<li>Expression rewriting doesn&#8217;t work on Mac or Windows source-code. Mac is going to be relatively straight-forward to support. MCPP doesn&#8217;t understand all of the Mac strangeness yet and needs a loving and affectionate mac user to teach it the ways of Darwin. Windows is more work as it will require both updating the mingw Mozilla port and porting MCPP.
<strong>Coolness</strong></li>

<p>I wrote outparamdel and tested it on a convoluted manual testcase. Then I ran outparamdel mozilla-wide with the above input and the resulting code compiled! This was never the case prior to MCPP work since I found find new and exciting preprocessor madness to work-around and special case with every new rewrite.</p>

<p><strong>Future</strong></p>

<p>Going to make this a little more challenging by rewriting QueryInterface to return result by a return value which should affect the majority of functions in Mozilla.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is always frustrating to see a compiler complain about something trivial. It is especially annoying since most of the trivial complaints are trivial to fix automatically (eg. superfluous semicolon).</p>

<p>I think this is a bigger problem in the static analysis industry. Vendors/researchers ship their tools with a superiority complex built-in. Most of the error messages produced by error checking tools can be paraphrased as &#8220;Gee look, I found some trivial to fix bugs in your code, but I ain&#8217;t gonna do nothing about them! Neeener! Go worker-human!&#8221;</p>

<p>My policy is to make my tools more polite than that. Starting from prcheck, all of my tools will point out simple errors by suggesting patches (when possible). It is impossible to produce a correct patch every time, but I am not worried about that since developers are quite good at disregarding stupid suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Whining</strong></p>

<p>Now I have a few extra scripts that lay the foundation for regular code inspection via static analysis. PRBool checks are my first step. Here is a sample email:

<p>This an example of an incorrect suggestion. The actual problem is due to the incorrect method overload being chosen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently MCPP started working well enough to process all of Mozilla with the special macro-expansion undoing markup. Below is the most exciting patch line I have produced so far. A few months ago, I didn&#8217;t think was possible to rewrite macro parameters with elsa.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>-    ENCODE_SIMPLE_ARRAY(PRBool, Bool, (PRUint16) values[i]);
</span><span class='line'>+    ENCODE_SIMPLE_ARRAY(PRBool, Bool, 0 != ((PRUint16) values[i]));
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To produce this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Elsa consumed the expanded .ii file</li>
<li>Boolean checker found the problematic subexpression</li>
<li>Original source position was calculated from the expansion log</li>
<li>Then prcheck figured out that only the macro parameter needs to be rewritten.</li>
<li>Original source was read in and enclosed within 0 != ()
<strong>Integrating Static Checks - PRBool check </strong></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=266048">This bug</a> contains the rest of the rewriting results. Prcheck checks every assignment to a prbool and outputs a patch if the expression may evaluate to anything other than 0/1. A message is produced if a patch can not be generated because the expression is within a macro.</p>

<p>The goal is to have prcheck run on every commit(or every day) and send out an email or another form of a complaint when a new prbool violation is introduced. Since the current prbool misuses aren&#8217;t going to be fixed overnight, there should be a db kept somewhere with the old misuses to prevent the new ones from being introduced and old ones from being annoying. I&#8217;m thinking of associating misuse counts with a filename, so when the number goes up an error gets mailed out. Anyone get a better idea?</p>

<p><strong>Latest Recipe to Running Oink Tools </strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If you want to rewrite sources either wait for the next mcpp release or use my <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/mcpp-post2.6.4.tar.gz">tarball</a>.</li>
<li>Install gcc 3.4.x. If using mcpp, configure mcpp with &#8211;enable-replace-system so it replaces the gcc preprocessor</li>
<li><a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/07/13/dehydra-prcheck-squash-in-mercurial/">Checkout</a> and build my oink version.</li>
<li>Build mozilla with -save-temps gcc option. If using mcpp set environment variables CC=&#8221;gcc -Wp,-K -Wp,-W0 -save-temps &#8221; and CXX=&#8221;g++ -Wp,-K -Wp,-W0 -save-temps &#8221; and do make -f client.mk build as usual. The extra gcc parameters tell it to save intermediate files to pass -K and -W0 to enable macro expansion annotation and silence warnings.</li>
<li>Run tools individual files</li>
<li>Produce a global patch with ./pork-barrel 4 /path/to/prcheck /tmp/input.txt where input.txt is a list of absolute filenames of all of the .i and .ii files produced by the build process</li>
</ol>
