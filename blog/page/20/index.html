  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looks like <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Pork">pork</a> is slowly going to get merged back into oink. This makes me happy as it will result in decreased merging headaches and gives more visibility to my work outside of Mozilla. My elkhound changes are already in!</p>

<p>Recently I added support for retaining gnu attributes to elsa and corresponding features dehydra and garburator. Now dehydra can verify things based on attributes andÂ  garburator gained a way to rewrite special cases like classes that are always <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409088">allocated on the stack</a>. Elsa still drops most attributes, but at least classes, methods and variable declarations are covered.</p>

<p>I also spent a couple of days investigating gcc plugins. Turns out modifying gcc to support plugins is dead easy, but getting anything useful done in GCC requires a steep learning curve. I tried to find how to enumerate all of the toplevel declarations in the source, but I couldn&#8217;t find the correct global variable that corresponds to the toplevel scope(aka the Translation Unit?). I have a few more ideas of what to try next. Once I do that, it shouldn&#8217;t take much work to make a basic gcc-hosted version of dehydra. There is also a gcc plugin branch hosted in the gcc svn, but I can&#8217;t find any example code for it. It isn&#8217;t a big deal since none of the plugins I&#8217;ve seen mentioned venture outside of intra-function analyses.</p>

<p>I am still pondering on how to tackle rewriting Mozilla to use exceptions. It is the key to improving overall readability/perf of Moz C++, but the logistics of writing the corresponding analyses+rewrites followed by a parallel manual correction step are still making my head spin. All I&#8217;m sure about is that the first step to exceptions would be to enable the OOM exceptions and do the corresponding exception safe analysis+rewrite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often there are two ways to write code. One way is to design an API and have code patterns adhere to how the API is supposed to be used. Another way is to rely on language features to accomplish the same thing. Typically API-pattern approaches are chosen because compilers are too immature or just don&#8217;t provide the necessary features. Sometimes compilers do catch up and the possibility of utilizing newer language features appears.</p>

<p>In the case of the exception rewrite the task is to rewrite code from a pattern-based (compiler in your head) approach to a more strict C++ construct-based exception paradigm. Unfortunately APIs don&#8217;t enforce their usage as much as a compiler (in part because we don&#8217;t have <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/2007/11/29/gcc-plugins-under-my-xmas-tree/">app-spefic compiler plugins</a>) so transforming that into a strict compiler-friendly form automatically isn&#8217;t always realistic (<a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/glue/nsIInterfaceRequestorUtils.cpp#43">example</a>). See my previous post for more examples.</p>

<p>Having done more work on the exception conversion I believe that it is possible to switch Mozilla to exceptions to the point of getting it to compile. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s possible to do this in the Mozilla2 timeframe due to the large amount of manual labour required.</p>

<p>Due to various use cases that don&#8217;t fit the exception model there is a need for an nsresult-lint tool to detect funny (see above) nsresult patterns so code can be manually fixed to enable thrower to transform code correctly.</p>

<p>I expect conversion to exceptions to consist of the following large steps:</p>

<p>XPCOMGC -> nsresult-lint -> thrower automatic conversion -> nsexception-lint -> outparamdel</p>

<ol>
<li>XPCOMGC needs to land first to simplify memory management. Otherwise there will be a lot more nsCOMPtr&lt;>s already_AddRefed&lt;>s and friends.</li>
<li>nsresult-lint would flag code for clean up to assist with the multitude of special cases in the code preventing it from transformation</li>
<li>thrower needs to do some reasonably sophisticated static analysis (sensitive to control flow) to ensure that code is rewritten correctly. The analysis step isn&#8217;t ridiculously hard, but it is considerably more complex than what is done in existing tools.</li>
<li>nsexception-lint tool will flag exception-unsafe code. I expect this to highlight a fair amount of code that needs to be converted to RAII. It will take more manual labour to fix flagged code here than in than step2.</li>
<li>Once exceptions are used the return value is freed up for outparamdel to utilize. This will be a nice optimization and code clean up.
I think the best bet with exceptions would be to start working on them during the moz2 development cycle to have them land early in post-moz2.</li>
</ol>


<p>Or as an alternative we could try to do just the OOM exceptions which are less frequent which would look like:</p>

<p>XPCOMGC -> thrower automatic conversion(OOM cases are easier) -> nsexception-lint</p>

<p>In this case the only significant piece of work is nsexception-lint which would be needed later for a full-blown exception rewrite. It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad to convert code to RAII even before that is required for the full exception rewrite.</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;m going let thrower rest in the pork hg repository while I try to make a <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/XPCOMGC/Static_Checker">static checker plugin</a> for gcc. Feel free to ask for clarification. I&#8217;m dealing with after-effects of insomnia so this may not be completely clear.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Reasonable <a href="http://www.hackcraft.net/raii/">description of RAII</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Typical</strong></p>

<p>It seems that there are 3 stages to doing a rewrite in Moz:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a new tool. Make sure that it can rewrite some trivial testcases. Add lots of asserts for cases you are unsure about.</li>
<li>Run tool on Mozilla and fix crashes caused by above asserts. Get 80% of the code rewriting correctly.</li>
<li>Get the other 20% rewriting. This often involves major overhauls to rewriting logic due to patterns that weren&#8217;t expected when the spec was written
Usually stage 3 is a few times harder than 2. For garburator rewriting got really hard in stage 3. 90% of my time ended up being spent in stage 3 due to fun issues like figuring out what to do with <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2007-11-08/perils-in-rewriting/">unforeseen</a>(in spec) combination of references and nsCOMPtr&lt;>s.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>With exceptions step 2 is already getting hard. So far I&#8217;ve had to extend elsa to support pattern matching,Â  and reworked the code patcher to support recursive rewriting.</p>

<p>Now looks like I&#8217;ll need to do some flow-sensitive analysis to rewrite cases like <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/base/nsMemoryImpl.cpp#217">nsMemoryImpl::FlushMemory</a>. I&#8217;m not sure if it is possible to automatically deal with functions like <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/base/nsExceptionService.cpp#290">nsExceptionService::DoGetExceptionFromProvider</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m not yet rewriting code to be bugfree, just trying to get it to compile. Once exceptioned code compiles, step two will be to statically check code to verify that it is exception-safe and convert it to RAII or something.</p>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/xpcom.diff">current patch</a> for xpcom/ produced by thrower. At the moment there are still a lot of pattern matches to be added. It mostly handles rv = foo(); if (NS_FAILED(rv)) and a few other simple <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/oink/?file/fbbcc3e9056b/thrower_tests/">cases</a>.</p>

<p>This is exciting stuff, but really hard, so if anyone has exciting problem solving ideas feel free to ping me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My previous post on outparam rewriting <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/2007/11/28/volume-of-refactoring-ahead/">described</a> the wealth of functions that can be rewritten. Unfortunately, most functions in Mozilla are declared in XPIDL interfaces.</p>

<p>I have been convinced that my plan to rewrite xpidlgen to avoid outparameters wont be possible because most XPIDLinterfaces can be implemented by JavaScript in a few different ways. That is problematic because in addition to return values, JavaScript can also have an exception thrown at any point and have that converted to an nsresult error code by XPConnect. That means that the getters implemented in JavaScript are not in the set of functions that only return NS_OK+outparam/someerror. I wouldn&#8217;t be at all disappointed if someone proved me wrong here.</p>

<p><strong>nsexception</strong></p>

<p>There is one other way to rid the code of outparameters (including getter_AddRefs and friends). Time to face my greatest reluctance: rewriting Mozilla to use exceptions. Brendan has been talking about it for a long time, but I have been skeptical until now, mostly due to the complexity of rewriting that much code. However, I have more confidence in rewriting huge amounts of code now since the XPCOMGC rewrite which touched most functions in Mozilla without too much trouble (in relative terms).</p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

<p>There are some obvious benefits to be gained from switching to exceptions other than a reduction in code-size (and footprint?) and having code that looks more like common C++.</p>

<p>We would like to modify tamarin to use C++ exceptions such that an exception thrown from JavaScript would unroll the mixed C++/JS stack. This would simplify and enable significant optimizations for XPConnect.</p>

<p>I am dreaming of JITed marshaling code for C++->JS calls and having a low level FFI interface(ie being able to call most C/C++ methods <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2007/09/hello-js-ctypes-goodbye-binary-components/">directly</a>) on the JavaScript side such that tracing JIT could automatically optimize common XPConnect calls. This an exciting area and there are lots of details to be worked out, so I&#8217;d love to see some feedback (or better yet proof of concept code!) on this.</p>

<p><strong>The Plan</strong> - Rewriting</p>

<p>I have started implementing thrower (I am not a great namer), a tool for converting various code patterns involving nsresult into something that uses an nsexception wrapper.</p>

<p>Since this rewrite requires a lot more scanning for code patterns I added an elsa feature to allow pattern matching on AST nodes in C++ (also using exceptions). Since there are lot of patterns to transform, for documentation I will be writing many minimal testcases documenting(and testing) exactly what gets rewritten. Any interested parties are welcome to contribute Mozilla error handling patterns as testcases.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying the Result </strong></p>

<p>Just like in the XPCOMGC rewrite, code will have to be scanned to verify that it fits in the &#8220;new world order&#8221;. Unlike XPCOMGC, there are additional flow-sensitive issues to scan for to ensure that the code is thread-safe. The scans are at a lower level than dehydra currently works at, so it&#8217;s a perfect opportunity to either extend dehydra or write the new tool.</p>

<p>It would be especially cool to implement the code analysis tool as a <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/2007/11/29/gcc-plugins-under-my-xmas-tree/">gcc plugin</a>.Â  Sean Callanan&#8217;s &#8220;Extending GCC with Modular GIMPLE Optimizations&#8221; paper in the <a href="http://ols2006.108.redhat.com/2007/GCC-Reprints/GCC2007-Proceedings.pdf">GCC summit proceedings</a> should be an excellent starting point.</p>

<p>This is an exciting experiment. I look forward to reducing speculation on the risks/benefits of switching the codebase to use exceptions with some concrete data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over at LWN there is an article on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/258700/">GCC plugins</a>. It touches onto how it would be useful to implement static analysis tools as GCC plugins.</p>

<p>It does not mention that certain optimizations are not feasible without interfacing with the compiler and that there could be a very significant decrease in errors if we the compiler were pluggable with API-specific checks. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if less developer time had to be spent hunting for common bugs and more implementing awesome new features?</p>

<p>Typically safety is accomplished by executing code in a Virtual Machine that does extra runtime checks with Just In Time compilation to make up for performance losses. This approach has many known performance and footprint disadvantages. It is used by languages like Java and Scheme.</p>

<p>Applications in these languages are slow and/or ship with a JIT compiler to optimize them during their runtime. C++ is compiled ahead of run time and has a reputation for running faster than these dynamic languages. However it also makes it a lot easier to make mistakes such as leak memory and buffer overflows. One can use the C++ OO system to perform extra-runtime checks to avoid some of these issues but that tends to cancel out any performance advantages of writing code in C++.</p>

<p>Another approach is to enforce various safety-related properties through the compiler. Awesome existing languages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a> come with a strict type system that ensures that once code compiles it will run fast and have a lower bug percentages than comparable code in other languages. EcmaScript4 will feature a rocking type system similar to OCaml.</p>

<p>C++ does not have such an awesome typesystem. However, there are many C++ errors that occur frequently and should be detected by the compiler, however long as there is no way to specify Mozilla-specific type system restrictions the compiler has no way of getting that information. Such plugins provide a certain piece of mind that once code complies with whatever rules we set for it, it is more likely to run correctly. Furthermore, some optimizations that we have in mind for Mozilla 2 (such as incremental garbage collection) will be much easier to work with if the compiler flags memory misuse at compile time.</p>

<p>Currently we can use dehydra to scan the codebase, but it would be much more efficient to be able to plug such verification abilities into every developer&#8217;s GCC. I sincerely hope that whoever is in charge of the plugin decision at GCC will realize the massive advantage this would give to GCC over other compilers.</p>

<p>ps. Another use for plugins is to enable more aggressive optimizations. Small changes in the sourcecode can affect how conservative the generated code this. A clever plugin could warn whenever gcc cancels an optimization due to misbehaving source.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the previous post, I described the simple rewriting case that I am working on at the moment. Someone was quick to point out that the approach wouldn&#8217;t work for all methods (XPIDL Arrays were the example). Indeed, anything more complicated than simple getters can&#8217;t be rewritten to &#8220;Succeeded/Failed&#8221; pattern without switching to C++ exceptions. However, in the codebase the size of Mozilla there are several megabytes worth outparam getters to be rewritten.</p>

<p>Currently my wimpy little <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/oink/?file/0ab46e97549e/dehydra_scripts/outparams.js">outparams.js</a> script identifies 100 methods that can be rewritten by outparamdel without any manual intervention. However doing a search for ::Get with a ** parameter yields over 2700 candidates, of which most look like they can be rewritten. Reason for the laughable detection rate is that the detection script currently refuses to flag methods that are defined in XPIDL interface or are implemented by more than one class. Soon the script will make heavier use of the class hierarchy and we will probably change XPIDL to support more efficient getters.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Class Hierarchy</strong></p>

<p>I finally managed to convince Dehydra to serialize the Mozilla class hierarchy into JSON files without running out of virtual memory. This will generate lots of input for refactoring and analysis tools. All kinds of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405855">interesting stats</a> can be produced with <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/oink/?file/0ab46e97549e/dehydra_scripts/find_single_impl.js">simple scripts</a>. Generating the index is relatively <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=DeHydra#Capturing_the_Moz_Class_Hierarchy">straightforward</a>. It would be awesome if someone could figure out how to expose this data as a web app. Since there is so much being loaded incrementally, I don&#8217;t see how one can keep things simple but use an asynchronous API.</p>

<p>In the coming months, I am looking forward to extending this to be a complete callgraph to find dead code and other fun data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There will be a lot of under-the-hood code changes in Mozilla 2. Our goal is to end up with a simpler, safer and faster codebase.</p>

<p>This is my perspective on the work ahead with respect to outparamdel.</p>

<p><strong>Outparamdel</strong></p>

<p>In the presence of a garbage collector we will be getting rid of stack nsCOMPtr&lt;> usage (using raw pointers instead), but the getter_Addrefs() will still be needed to pass references to heap-allocated nsCOMPtr so they can be assigned to. Eliminating as many outparams as possible will eliminate much getter_Addrefs() footprint/perf/code bloat.</p>

<p>Within the next week I hope to attempt to rewrite all of the auto-detectable outparamdel candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Determining What To Rewrite</strong></p>

<p>outparams.js is a dehydra script for flagging code that can be rewritten to use outparameters. It turned out a bit trickier than I initially expected. Here are the checks required</p>

<ol>
<li>Check that a function only ever returns 1 failure error code (NS_OK and something else). This enough if a function is not virtual.</li>
<li>Ensure that either a) This is the only implementation of a particular virtual function or b) All other implementations of this function satisfy 1 Currently I only do a).</li>
<li>Also check that all overloads of this function have the same outparameter type. This is required since C++ (thankfully) doesn&#8217;t not allow function overloading by varying the return type.</li>
<li>Checks 1-3 ensure that the function can be rewritten, however one also needs to determine if the return type should be wrapped in getter_Addrefs&lt;>. This can not be deterministically done from looking at the getter. So one has to scan the code for usage of the function to see if the outparam is ever passed getter_Addrefs.</li>
<li>Check that none of the callers are within macros to minimize non-automatic rewriting.
Checks 2 and 3 require the complete class hierachy of Mozilla so I finally made a few more dehydra scripts to produce that. This was on my TODO list for a while and should make a few other interesting analyses possible (my favourite one is finding interfaces which only have 1 implementation to get rid of excessive virtual functions).</li>
</ol>


<p>Checks 4 and 5 were easiest to implement as warnings in outparamdel.</p>

<p>One should keep in mind transitivity. Once the first outparamdel candidates are rewritten, some of their callers should become flagged for rewriting in the same manner.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting Code </strong></p>

<p>Here is an example of how code will be simplified.</p>

<p>given a function:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>nsresult getFoo(nsIFoo **out);
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And usage like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; bla;
</span><span class='line'>nsresult rv = getFoo(getter_Addrefs(bla));</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>if ((NS_SUCCEEDED(rv) && bla) {
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>} else {
</span><span class='line'>return rv;
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; bla2;
</span><span class='line'>return getFoo(getter_Addrefs(bla2));
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The function definition will become:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nsIFoo* getFoo();
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before this can be done, several issues come up</p>

<ol>
<li>It is not clear if the original getFoo() is allowed to always override the value passed to it. This is hard to determine automatically, so we make the assumption that in the general case it is ok.</li>
<li>It isn&#8217;t obvious if getFoo() is returns null in the outparam to indicate some non-error condition. This is rare so the parameter shall be annotated. Currently, the plan is to annotate with a NULLABLE_OUTPARAM() macro which would be detectable by dehydra and serve as documentation for the function behavior.</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; bla = getFoo(); //after XPCOMGC rewrite the left side will become nsIFoo* bla
</span><span class='line'>if (bla) { // could even merge the above declaration into the if condition
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>} else {
</span><span class='line'>return NS_ERROR;// or NULL if this is another outparamdel candidate
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIFoo&gt; bla2 = getFoo();
</span><span class='line'>return bla2 ? NS_OK : NS_ERROR_SOMETHING; // I'm not sure if outparamdel should use an explicit ternary operator or an inline function to convert new style errors into nsresult
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Currently the code is being rewritten in a much uglier way. So this cleaner version will likely be implemented as an optimization pass (probably with a new tool outparamdel-opt?). There several tricks here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect the declaration with initialization of bla and bla2</li>
<li>Detect the error check and replace it with &#8220;bla&#8221;(or !bla for NS_FAILED).Then realize that bla &amp;&amp; bla contains a redundant statement and take it out.</li>
<li>Do something similar to return statements.
<strong>Result</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>This should result in prettier code that compiles quicker and to a smaller, more efficient binary. It will also be more GC-friendly.</p>

<p><strong>C++ Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>Right now outparamdel does rewrites that are useful even if C++ exceptions will not be introduced. There are further code reduction gains possible if above error checks were converted into C++ exceptions, but I am not clear on performance characteristics of exceptions. We would also need to change tamarin exceptions to match C++ ones before any experimentation can be done.</p>

<p>The pork suite now has a <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Pork">wiki page</a>.</p>

<h1>mercurial regulars kindly educated me about hg branches. Turned out hgimportsvn tries to map some subversion concepts onto hg branches which causes problems for people checking out pork using never versions of hg. For people googling for this issue: do &#8220;hg up trunk ; hg branch -f default; hg commit&#8221; to produce a magic empty revision to fix this problem.</h1>

<p>If you have tried to compile pork before and gave up in despair, please try again using the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Pork">pork wiki page</a> for instructions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/2007/10/12/rewriting-tools-for-mozilla-2-moving-forward-as-planned/">few weeks</a> ago I convinced myself that is possible to rewrite Mozilla to avoid COMPtrs on the stack. Since then I&#8217;ve changed my mind a few times and felt like I may not be able to get this rewrite working. However, after three or four false starts, I finally managed to work out a metal model of the stack nsCOMPtr usage. With a combination of automatic blacklisting of tricky code, manual demacroing and lots of help from <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/">Benjamin</a> I got the generated 3.2MB patch to compile.</p>

<p>I am sure that there are lots of bugs to be found still, but at least we&#8217;ve discovered the pattern that the code follows. I am also sure that there are lots of unpleasant surprises to be discovered and dealt with in the near future.</p>

<p>The bright side is that the result of these rewrites we should get a less buggy codebase that is easier to work on, more efficient and compiles to smaller binaries. My other big wish is to significantly reduce the amount of C++ magic in the codebase.</p>

<p>I am happy that garburator works as it means I can go back to playing <a href="http://tarasglek.github.com/taras/category/outparamdel/">outparamdel</a>. Hopefully, once garburator+outparamdel are applied on all possible methods we&#8217;ll end up with relatively nice looking C++ code and a healthy performance boost.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m having a very painful time rewriting Mozilla source code to switch it to garbage collection. So I took a little break to think about Myk&#8217;s <a href="http://www.melez.com/mykzilla/2007/10/automated-js-code-rewriting.html">JavaScript rewriting idea</a>.Then I found excellent info on <a href="http://siliconforks.com/doc/parsing-javascript-with-spidermonkey/">parsing JS</a> with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey</a>. The downside to SpiderMonkey is that it is in C and thus hard to reuse, the upside is that will be able to parse all valid JavaScript.</p>

<p>I think I shall find some free time to prototype a little tool to take a .js file and produce a JSON representation of it such that one could write transformation passes in JavaScript. This will be useful as it will complete DeHydra by enabling it to process JS in addition to C++ and it will save a lot of time for various JavaScript refactorings.</p>

<p>I expect developing a JS refactoring tool to be relatively trivial compared to refactoring C++ as there is no source-code mangling going on due to lack of preprocessing (but JS is dynamic and can be embedded in various document types, so that could complicate things). Perhaps it would even be of use to mozpad people.</p>

<p>Looking forward to playing more with this idea.</p>
