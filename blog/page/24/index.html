  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Positive</strong></p>

<p>Since the last blog post, I have been investigating on how to teach elsa about the C preprocessor. Overall, I am really happy that <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/">MCPP</a> exists and is actively maintained. Preprocessed source code may not be invertible into the original form, but at least it can be undone enough for refactoring purposes.</p>

<p>Looks like I should be able to preprocess the source code, and while at it record macro expansion information and then have elsa fed with a somewhat xml-escue data structure.</p>

<p>The way I see it, a line of code like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>foo = PR_MAX(boo(), nsnull)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which expands into</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>foo =  boo() &gt; 0 ? boo() : 0;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will get fed to elsa as something like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;fragment&gt;foo = &lt;macro id=somemacro_instance&gt;PR_MAX(boo(), nsnull)&lt;/macro&gt;;&lt;/fragment&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where somemacro_instance is defined as</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;fragment&gt;&lt;fragment ref=some_fragment/&gt; &gt; 0 ? &lt;fragment ref=some_fragment/&gt; : &lt;macro id=some_staticmacro&gt;0&lt;/macro&gt;&lt;/fragment&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where some_staticmacro is defined as</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;fragment&gt;0&lt;/fragment&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I think this is a cute scheme because fragments are basically regions of source-code. This is exciting because once a macro is used in the code, the text fragment that defines the macro can be parsed as C++ and rewritten accordingly. Obviously, this wouldn&#8217;t be the default behavior.</p>

<p>If you see a fatal flow in the above model, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>

<p>My main reason for adding preprocessor support to elsa is to obtain precise source locations from elsa. Ironically, MCPP &#8220;compresses&#8221; whitespace, so column information is basically thrown out of the window. Means I&#8217;ll have to do some extensive culling of the compression code (which is everywhere).</p>

<p>Another fun issue is that the general structure of MCPP encourages the &#8220;lots of global variables and defines&#8221; mode of programming. It also uses strings-as-a-data-structure pattern which may make me give up on the fancy onion-peel model I described above and instead have mcpp generate preprocessed code along with an &#8220;undo&#8221; type log.</p>

<p>MCPP is also a bit on the slow side compared to GCC, but I&#8217;ll trade a second or two slowdown per file for never having to cry due to CPP again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have gotten used to dodging CPP-expansion issues by fudging column &amp; line information until the position info in squash mostly matches the source positions in the original source code. That sufficed for rewriting declarations, but I have finally hit a brick wall.</p>

<p><strong>CPP Fun</strong></p>

<p>I got as far with call-site outparam rewriting as <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/outparams.May11.diff">this patch</a>. It demonstrates an interesting flaw.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>@@ -8297,1 +8297,1 @@
</span><span class='line'>-  GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, nsnull, &insertionPoint, &multiple);
</span><span class='line'>+  insertionPoint = GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, &insertionPoint, &multiple);
</span><span class='line'>@@ -8346,1 +8346,1 @@
</span><span class='line'>-          GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, child, &insertionPoint);
</span><span class='line'>+          insertionPoint = GetInsertionPoint(parentFrame, child);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Due to macro expansion, nsnull contracts to 0 such that the .i file has &amp;insertionpoint positioned right in the middle of nsnull (in the .cpp file). So when squash trims the param including the surrounding commas, it ends up removing the wrong parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Elsa Limitation</strong></p>

<p>I have mentioned lack of end-of-ast-node position information in Elsa. It also lacks start-of-ast-node information for most expressions. This makes selectively rewriting source code rather difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>

<p>Instead of fighting an uphill fudging battle against CPP, I am going to have to suspend outparam rewriting yet again to work on better position information and integrating a preprocessor into elsa. This is unfortunate because I was looking forward to finally doing something more sophisticated than renames. Now my elsa fork is going to grow even bigger before I get commit access.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Automatic code rewriting business can be a little depressing sometimes. I tend to run into funny issues caused by CPP, oink limitations or just unpleasant-to-rewrite parts of C++. After banging my head against the wall due to all these issues I finally arrived at a workable approach for the easy part of the outparam rewrite.</p>

<p>Currently I have a dehydra script that finds all non-virtual getters that return either NS_OK or <em>NS_SOMETHING_IS_WRONG</em>. The script then outputs data for squash to base the rewrites on. Then squash takes over.</p>

<p>In order to preserve sanity, pretty-printing is not used at all for rewriting the getter functions. This way one doesn&#8217;t have to worry about oink generating invalid C++ and the output is much more aesthetically pleasing. Instead, squash finds interesting expressions in the .i file. Then it extracts the corresponding strings from .h/.cpp files. The strings are used to fudge the position information obtained from the .i file to vaguely correspond to the original source files. After various C++ string-foo, squash produces a promising looking patch like <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/outparams.May10.diff">this</a>.</p>

<p>This also relies on a fair amount of semantic information provided by elsa/oink. For example when removing a parameter, squash inserts a local variable with the same name and then removes all of the derefences of the old parameter. Since there could be multiple variables with the same name, squash relies on elsa&#8217;s variable resolution.</p>

<p>I think squash is now 50% feature complete with respect to outparam stuff. The other 50% is the hard part of rewriting all of the call-sites. I&#8217;m not counting easy parts like wrapping the return type in already_AddRefed&lt;>, eliminating redundant assignments in the getter or removing the error variable once it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>This still doesn&#8217;t add the already_AddRefed or other important attributes, but that should be easy. The result looks simple, but getting squash from working with a testcase to an actual source file was a little on the painful side.</p>

<p>After my experience with renaming I have realized that squash should avoid the C++ pretty printer for now. Thus the result is produced in a verbose AST-sensitive regexp-like way. However figuring out where things start and end is incredibly painful due to the presence of the preprocessor.</p>

<p>My plan is to get squash rewriting some basic Mozilla code the painful way and then I use what I learned to integrate <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/">mcpp</a> along with the much coveted end-of-ast-node info into elsa.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript is an AST&#8217;s Best Friend </strong></p>

<p>Until recently I have been doing a lot of work with dehydra. Now that it is feature-complete I am back to working on squash fulltime and I miss JavaScript already. JS is much better suited for messing about with Abstract Syntax Trees. It is so nice to be able to print out any data structure, create new ones without modifying a billion files and the lack of C++ compile/linking delay is nice too. It&#8217;s amazing how much simpler it is to analyze functions for out-param rewriting in JS compared to checking for simpler patterns in C++. I am seriously excited about Tamarin/ES4 and the productivity boost that it will provide.</p>

<p>I wonder whether a complete JS binding for Elsa would be a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Emacs</strong></p>

<p>Switching to a Mac finally made me switch to Emacs. I could not find any other editors that would be support the workflow I was used to with SciTE or Kate. Other than absolutely hating the majoring of Emacs shortcuts (who&#8217;s idea was Ctrl-^ and the crazy undo/redo) I love the editor for the amazing term mode. It&#8217;s a little buggy in the current version, but the CVS version is good enough to comfortably run vim in it for quick edits :). It&#8217;s so nice to keep all of my terminals and code in the same window. I am dreaming of the day when Emacs will undergo the Mozilla->Firefox-like modernization.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Automated Analyses and Rewrites</strong></p>

<p>Dehydra and Squash are now mature enough to assist with mundane tasks like renames and various kinds of tedious code inspection. If you ever suspect that part of the Mozilla hacking you are doing could be done by a tool, contact me to see if I have a suitable tool for you.</p>

<p>Also, these tools are in no way limited to working with Mozilla source code. I would be happy to see people use them for other projects too.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term Plans</strong></p>

<p>For the next week or two I plan to focus on out-parameter rewriting and the Mozilla-wide C++ callgraph.</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla-wide Callgraph</strong> This is proving to be a little painful. Things work for basic test-cases, but I am running into scalability issues with Mozilla (as expected). My current approach of serializing everything into a giant JSON graph blows the 32bit address space after a few hundred files. Even doing a Mozilla-wide inheritance graph causes out of memory errors, but that runs almost to competition. The best solution to this will be to break up the graph into as many smaller JSON files as possible and only load ones that are absolutely required into memory.</p>

<p>The callgraph will be a useful starting point for many other useful analyses (dead code one is going to be lots of fun) and it&#8217;s a good test of dehydra&#8217;s scalability, but I have suspended work on it for a few days to focus on more productive tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Out-parameter Rewriting</strong></p>

<p>Due to XPCOM, Mozilla getters typically return an error code and a value via an out parameter. This requires checking the error code and likely propagating it at the callsite.</p>

<p>For many places in the code there are performance and aesthetical reasons to stop using error codes. Brendan talks discusses some reasons <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/10/mozilla_2.html">here</a>. This would be cool stuff, but switching to exceptions isn&#8217;t going to happen right away. However, I can already start working on my tools to assist with simpler cases (like <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;q=+nsBidiPresUtils::GetBidiEngine+show:kW5gzhxHJvU:iRn_dfI9xJY:Y5Gdp6b4NgE&amp;sa=N&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=rc&amp;cs_p=http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.7a/src/mozilla-source-1.7a.tar.bz2&amp;cs_f=mozilla/layout/base/src/nsBidiPresUtils.cpp#a0">nsBidiPresUtils::GetBidiEngine</a>?). I&#8217;m focusing on getters that return NS_OK/(some error) and a value and rewriting them to return NULL on error and non-NULL on success. This could be ready in time for Firefox 3. Once I&#8217;m done with the tool, I&#8217;ll just need someone to help me figure which functions are ok to simplify like that.</p>

<p>I suspended work on out-param rewriting <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/01/11/squash-progress-and-plans/">some time ago</a>. It was proving to be too complicated to do within squash. Now that I can use dehydra to verify the control flow graph, things are a lot simpler. Current plan is to have the <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/outparams.js">dehydra script</a> produce a list of candidates for out-param surgery and have squash consume that list and produce the appropriate patches. Currently, the script works for some very simple cases and I am working on the squash side.</p>

<p><strong>Smaller Tasks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sayrer&#8217;s uninitialized member analysis: added more complete constructor support to dehyra, wrote a <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/member-init.js">sample script</a> to get sayrer started. Fixed dehydra&#8217;s 64bit support. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378763">Bug 378763</a></li>
<li>Made some squash-generated patches for bz, helped me find a bug in squash. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378780">Bug 378780</a></li>
<li>Pushing squash upstream into oink. This is time consuming because it is a combination of legal and many minor technical issues. Dehydra will follow later.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My last attempt at visualizing the Mozilla class hierarchy ended up being way too slow to be useful. So I based my second attempt on using a different <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/jscript/graphic_javascript_tree.asp">tree layout</a>. After quite a few scalability optimizations, the graphing performance is now bearable.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/classbrowser/classbrowser.html">class browser</a> uses the canvas tag to draw the pretty boxes &amp; lines and links back into lxr. The class browser consumes a JSON file produced by running DeHydra on the layout/ directory. I am happy that I am finally able to examine gigantic code graphs interactively thanks to the <canvas> tag.</p>

<p>In the near future I hope to produce a few different kinds of complete graphs of the entire Firefox codebase. The idea is to have them generated nightly. Then that if someone has a general question about the Firefox codebase, it could be expressed as JavaScript within an interactive console in the browser. The answer would be either be graphed or returned as a JSON object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most static analysis tools don&#8217;t let you script them. Oink is an example of that. Adding a new analysis requires extending an existing tool with a feature which may not fit in smoothly or writing a new tool in C++ with the corresponding boilerplate to handle command-line arguments, etc.</p>

<p>At the other extreme lives UNO which has a DSL that is designed strictly for solving control-flow programs.</p>

<p>I chose JavaScript for Dehydra to get the power of a full-blown (and memory safe) programming language while keeping JS&#8217;s view of the code under analysis as simple as possible. I think I got the C++/JS mix just right, the C++ codebase is growing slowly, yet I add JS scripts for any little task.</p>

<p>Additionally JS came in handy for publishing the data on the web. I wrote a <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/inheritance.js">script</a> to determine the class inheritance graph. Then I added a little prefix to the <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/graph/examples/inheritance.js">file produced</a>, combined it with <a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/blog/projects/jsviz/">jsviz</a> and ended up with a really slow and unusable, but somewhat pretty <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/graph/examples/classes.html">class browser</a>. This could evolve to be a rather neat way to supplement LXR.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Squash </strong></p>

<p>If you are working on any C++ refactoring, especially if it involves function calls, spans multiple files or feels like you need a compiler in your head to help you, drop me a note to see if <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Squash">squash</a> can help. Squash provides a great deal of control over the refactoring process because it is not tied to a particular IDE and can be customized to accommodate for special cases.</p>

<p>On Friday, two squash-produced patches landed:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376042">212K patch</a> to rename nsIFrame::GetPresContext to PresContext. It took a couple of minutes to produce a patch for mac &amp; linux, and then some manual labour to complete it so it builds on Windows too. Unfortunately, Microsoft C++ is not yet supported by Oink. Windows-specific code will require magnitudes more of human labour until such support is contributed.</li>
<li>A much simpler patch to calls to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375878">remove uses of the deprecated ::Recycle()</a>. This took a few minutes once I added support for renaming global functions to squash.
<strong>Dehydra</strong></li>

<p>C++ support in dehydra is coming along splendidly. I started working on cross-function analysis support. Currently my goal is to allow the user to build callgraphs of Mozilla. The first application of that is going to be dead code detection.</p>

<p>In the meantime, contact me if you are looking for patterns in the code that grep wont help with : control flow-sensitive code, type &amp; syntax-aware matching, API misuse, etc. Dehydra can probably help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dehydra does a form of basic symbolic execution now. It&#8217;s enough to avoid the <em><a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/03/02/uno-dos...-dehydra">unfeasable</a> </em>branches. It enabled me to add known_zero() and known_notzero() so dehydra supports all of the functions documented in the <a href="http://www.spinroot.com/uno/uno_long.pdf">UNO paper</a>.</p>

<p>I believe dehydra can now match all of the features of uno&#8217;s DSL. Download it <a href="http://spinroot.com/uno/">here</a>. See malloc.js for an example of how to port UNO scripts. There is no documentation, except for this blog, but the docs on the <a href="http://spinroot.com/uno/">UNO website</a> should work too.</p>

<p>This is the first release so there are bugs, but the tool should be able to find some API-misuse issues, etc. I need some early adopters to help direct the evolution of this tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>A Creature so Fierce&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wrestling with control flow graphs <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/hydra.png">like this</a>. I eliminated those pesky &#8220;empty&#8221; nodes found in the previous incarnations, improved branching to track conditions and realized that what I&#8217;m really doing is developing a tool to bite off the excessive necks and heads (otherwise known as edges and basic blocks) of the Hydra monster that is represented by the bloody graph. Thus, say hello to DeHydra which was once known as <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/02/01/lossy-ast-traversals-for-good-code-health">dos</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DeHydra Plans</strong></p>

<p>I am quite happy with how dehydra is turning out. JavaScript is a nice language to pattern match code in a flow sensitive fashion and the uno-style api seems appropriate for the task.</p>

<p>In the near term I really need some value-awareness through abstract interpretation. For example, <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/hydra-unfeasible.png">this graph</a> of a <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~tglek/hydra-unfeasible.c">simple function</a> demonstrates several things that dehydra will need to notice:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a path from hydra-unfeasable.c:6 to hydra-unfeasable.c:10 and that those blocks are part of only a single control flow, not 4.</li>
<li>hydra-unfeasable.c:12 requires a contradiction in the condition in order to have flow through it and should be dropped or even reported as dead code.
I pondered a number of approaches ranging from value analysis, using a theorem prover and reversing conditions via prolog code. A simple C++ symbolic expression interpreter in C++ seems like the most productive thing at this point. So I will focus on that in the next short while.</li>
</ol>


<p>While I was reviewing my options I found a paper on <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jspacco/marmoset/papers/hovemeyer-paste2005.pdf">null pointer analysis for Java</a> to be a useful stating point for references to other relevant literature.</p>

<p><strong>Longer Term DeHydra Plans</strong></p>

<p>There is literature on how source-to-source transformation (like squash but also like the future C++ to ES4 tool) is assisted by flow sensitive static analysis tools (like dehydra) which I will have to absorb. DeHydra will gain whole-program analysis capability by:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Inlining control flow graphs</em> into the main() function</li>
<li>Supporting user-defined function attributes and using some sort of <em>attribute inference </em>(like in ML) to propagate them. This method would have higher performance, but less precision.
For the above to work will also need support for a user-correctable/suggestable callgraph to compensate for function pointers and dynamic module loading. This should also be enough to do dead code and module detection. Oh and I want dehydra to support JavaScript for doing cross-language analysis.</li>
</ol>


<p>There is also <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~jwhaley/papers/pldi04.pdf">Whaley&#8217;s paper</a> which uses prolog as a concise and expressive query engine for the source code. I would really like to see dehydra evolve such capabilities.</p>

<p>All this will take more than a little time on my own, but this stuff is too exciting for other impatient people to idly observe.</p>
