  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our last meeting was last Thursday, at 11am PST (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2011-12-08">meeting notes</a>). This blog post is late because of a combination of email disasters and travel.</p>

<p>Cheng from the SUMO team mined SUMO inputs to see what our users are complaining most about. There were complaints about things were slow, unresponsive, frozen, etc. See meeting notes the complete blurb.</p>

<p>The networking team has identified issues leading to slow <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709297">shutdown</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=695003">startup</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler#Running%20the%20profiler">responsiveness profiler</a> landed.</p>

<p>UX team provided an extensive list of Firefox features that needed tweaking, see meeting notes for details.  We are working on improving tab interactions and scrolling.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post a beefier summary of plans/accomplishments next week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I would like to see Firefox developers switch to 24hour review turn-around times. Note that in my definition review turn-around means any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>r+/r-</li>
<li>unset/reassign r? to someone else
It is ridiculous in our recent faster release cycle if a patch takes half (or more) of the cycle loitering in the review queue. I believe that a shorter review cycle is the simplest way to accelerate Firefox evolution.</li>
</ul>


<p>I view fast review times as a matter of respect. Posting a patch usually requires a significant time/effort commitment, reviewers should act appropriately. There is no bigger buzzkill than having your work pushed back to the bottom of somebody&#8217;s TODO list like some annoying chore.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell there are 3 main reasons* that lead to long review times:</p>

<p>1) People like gavin, bz, dbaron having disproportionally high review loads. We need a process to hand-off patches to other reviewers. High-load people shouldn&#8217;t shy away from passing on the r? to someone else when possible. 2) Bugzilla-fobic people (like myself) loosing track of bugzilla r? requests due to not having bugzilla <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/editwhines.cgi">whines</a> setup. Bugzilla whines should be enabled by default. 3) Bad review habits.  I met a number of Mozilla developers that like to batch their reviews up and then do them all on a single weekday. Please stop, you are killing all kinds of coding momentum/fun/etc.Lets make it our policy to set aside time every day to clear the review queue.</p>

<p>Clearly people with existing backlogs will take a while to catch up, but most MoCo employees should be capable of this. I have yet to hear a good reason against doing daily reviews.</p>

<p>It has been a few months since I proposed this on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.platform/browse_thread/thread/d563bf8329089a5/cdc47838866b0bea">dev.platform</a>.  I have tried to live by the 24hour rule, I think a few others tried this too. I find that morning bugzilla r? whines work best for me. I still occasionally loose track of a patch for a few days, but nobody is perfect. I think people appreciate fast reviews, but nobody thanked me yet.</p>

<p><strong>Dec 6 Update</strong>: My goal is to have <em>some</em> response within 24hours with an ETA for next followup in the worst case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago I started project <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy">Snappy</a>. The purpose of the meeting is to help us focus on eradicating jarring pauses in Firefox.</p>

<p>Today we had our second meeting (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2011-12-01">notes</a>).  A surprising amount of work has happened between the first and second meeting:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=chromehang&amp;list_id=1813678">Chromehang </a>was briefly turned on. This converted browser stalls of >30seconds into crashes. This showed that a number of issues are worse than previously assumed</li>
<li>We are about to start <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699051">tracking</a> slow SQL queries via telemetry</li>
<li>Even though <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a> is the new hotness, existing websites use the evil old DOM Storage API. This API is not asynchronous and degrades browser performance. The workaround is to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704933">tell</a> the backend to use async IO.
Just like MemShrink, Snappy bugs fall into three categories:</li>
<li>P1: Should be fixed ASAP</li>
<li>P2: Should be fixed as soon as developers have cycles for it</li>
<li>P3: Everything else
Multiple people have asked whether Snappy is appropriate for bugs caught by Chromehang: ie should we focus on one-off long delays (ie font enumeration) or small delays that happen frequently (ie tab animations). After reflecting on this I decided that UI jank can be thought of as a risk of frustrating the user. Risk has a scientific definition: severity of event multiplied by probability.  Thus a long occasional pause during browsing is equivalent to a frequent short pause.</li>
</ul>


<p>For next week we plan to wrap up a <a href="http://benoitgirard.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/firefox-built-in-profiler/">profiler</a>, come up with a fix for cache io on startup/shutdown, look into submitting hang stacks in a less <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=706916">brutal way</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mozilla requires a unixy dev environment. Makefiles, hg, patches, ssh, irc, etc. Unfortunately Windows lacks in terminal abilities. No tabs, crappy cut/paste, limited size, slow, etc.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-10-20-emacs-cmd-exe/emacs.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-10-20-emacs-cmd-exe/emacs.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Emacs has a wonderful shell-mode(ie my bottom-left buffer). This means that windows can now do proper command history, cut/paste &amp; use multiple emacs buffers(like tabs in a more sane terminal). Like all good features in emacs, out of the box shell mode is pretty busted, but can be <a href="http://www.khngai.com/emacs/cygwin.php">fixed</a> to default to bash. Microsoft also <a href="http://oscarbonilla.com/2008/01/beautiful-emacs-windows-edition/">provides</a> a very nice fixed width font for emacs. I keep my <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/emacs/">emacs config</a> in hg. I really appreciate the operating system that is emacs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The JavaScript error console is a relic from the Mozilla stone age. There are two problems with it:</p>

<ol>
<li>It lives in a separate window</li>
<li>It is not helpful
I&#8217;ve been drooling over the new Firefox Web Console, but unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t have chrome privs [yet?] so it isn&#8217;t a replacement for the error console since it operates with privileges of the webpage displayed. Turns out I was 2 steps away from nirvana:</li>
<li>Navigate to <a href="chrome://global/content/console.xul">chrome://global/content/console.xul</a>.</li>
<li>Menu -> &#8220;Web Developer&#8221; -> &#8220;Web Console&#8221;
Turns out that one can load a url with chrome privs (about:memory works too) and the web console becomes a very helpful [with autocompletion, less noise, etc) tool for typing Components.interfaces&#8230;</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Scratchpad can also do this sans autocompletion, see Rob&#8217;s comment below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Linux Plumbers</strong></p>

<p>A few of us attend LinuxPlumbers last month, I gave <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~tglek/lpc2011/">talk</a>. Basic summary: kernel + toolchain could add a few straight-forward features to make Firefox and other apps start faster and use less memory.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Team</strong></p>

<p>I am no longer alone on my quest of performance whack-a-mole. Since spring I&#8217;ve been growing a team of extremely talented people to help make Firefox faster and slimmer. As a manager I do more people tasks now, so I have less &#8221; ____ sucks&#8221; blog posts to write. We are currently working on massively speeding up Fennec startup via <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686805">incremental decompression</a> (sort of like an efficient UPX for android), fixing SQLite + other IO <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611837">usage</a> in Firefox, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662397">reordering binaries</a> for faster startup, faster <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662444">shutdown</a>. The idea is to focus on all areas of browser performance other than rendering the web (for now).</p>

<p><strong>Performance Help</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Perf work is cool, but I wouldn&#8217;t know where to start with finding a good first perf-bug&#8221; &lt;&#8211; is this you? Would any of my readers be interested in a roundup of next set of &#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221; perf-improvements to be had?</p>

<p>Example bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=693485">Implement </a>readahead support on Android</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=613124#c1">readahead</a> for omnijars</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>****Firefox 7 marks a turning point in how we measure Firefox performance. Traditionally we measured Firefox performance on individual developer machines and our build &amp; release infrastructure. However it turns out synthetic benchmarks do not correspond to real-world Firefox usage: it is difficult to model a &#8220;typical&#8221; computer in a lab environment. Surprisingly slow consumer hardware, changes in usage patterns, preinstalled bloatware all affect Firefox performance in surprising ways.</p>

<p>Firefox 7 telemetry will prompt users to opt-in to reporting performance data to Mozilla. This data will supplement our existing benchmarking infrastructure to help us optimize future Firefox releases. Telemetry performance metrics are very lightweight and will not negatively impact Firefox performance.</p>

<p>In addition to transmitting data via SSL, Mozilla privacy team worked tirelessly to ensure that no personally-identifiable information is sent via telemetry. Whereas many other software projects stamp this kind of data with a unique per-user id, we opted for a per-session id which is reset every time the browser restarts. Telemetry is also disabled while in private-browsing mode.</p>

<p>The following telemetry data will be gathered in Firefox 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>Memory usage</li>
<li>CPU core count</li>
<li>Cycle collection times</li>
<li>Startup speed
Use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/abouttelemetry/">about:telemetry</a> extension to check on your browser performance. The following screenshot shows how to enable telemetry:</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://people.mozilla.com/~tglek/telemetry/telemetry-ff7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m very excited that Firefox finally joins the ranks of cars, airplanes and other software projects in making performance decisions based on real evidence gathered in the wild.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>****Firefox 7 features improved startup speed. Our research has shown that most OSes are not capable of starting large programs efficiently (see my older blog entries). As a result, Firefox 7 will explicitly tell the OS to aggressively preload our xul.dll/libxul.so/XUL library before passing it on to the runtime linker. This marks the productization of the approach explored in &#8220;20-line patch that doubles Firefox startup&#8221; that got people so excited. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=552864">bug 552864</a> and dependent bugs for exciting technical details.</p>

<p><strong>Do Not Try this at Home: Ugly Windows</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: Windows Prefetch does everything possible to thwart exciting startup optimizations.</em> Above optimization only works when prefetch is disabled/broken (ie Firefox should be faster with Windows Prefetch off). See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=627591#c158">this comment</a> on disabling prefetch for Firefox. Alternatively one may get Windows Prefetch to not slow down Firefox startup by the following magic incantation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Firefox (or delete the windows prefetch entry for existing Firefox 7)</li>
<li>Reboot (Do not start Firefox after installation!)</li>
<li>Start Firefox.
Above helps populate the Windows Prefetch in a less counter-productive way. Explanation: on warm startup Windows Prefetch records irrelevant IO operations and blocks Firefox startup to preload files that Firefox accesses <em>after</em> startup.</li>
</ol>


<p>Note: the <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/nsBrowserApp.cpp#224">heuristic</a> that we use to detect Windows Prefetch will also prevent this optimization from kicking in on some exceptionally slow hard drives when prefetch is off. This is unfortunate as this optimization is most dramatic on exceptionally slow machines.</p>

<p>According to our preliminary telemetry data, less than 25% of our Windows users have Windows Prefetch off and can benefit from vastly improved startup. We expect to improve this in future Firefox releases by scheduling a prefetch cleanup operation similar to the script in above bugzilla comment.</p>

<p>Operating systems without counter-productive startup heuristics (ie Mac/Linux) will simply allow Firefox 7 to start faster.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like having guests who bike. So when Brian came over I decided this would be a great opportunity to explore going to the coast and back by bike (<a href="http://velodirt.com">velodirt</a> style). The following is a map of our trip (190miles, 2 nights).</p>

<p><a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/files/2011/08/map.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/bike.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The gravel roads were somewhat challenging. It was hard to climb in the heat so at times we had to push our bikes.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/push_small.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/push_small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Things got more unpleasant when we encountered loose gravel by Tillamook which sent Brian sliding over the edge :(</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/205869_704363319326_122500004_37237117_241562_n.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/205869_704363319326_122500004_37237117_241562_n.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Amazingly he got off without a single scratch (type-inference will go on!).</p>

<p>Eventually we got to <a href="http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_186.php">Cape Lookout</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/beach1_small.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/beach1_small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The next day we biked to and spent the night in <a href="http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_201.php">Nehalem Bay</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/beach2_small.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/beach2_small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Then it was time to head back :(</p>

<p>On the way back we did some more gravel roads, this time they were really nice. The road took us through a berry-laden forest and rewarded us with some pretty awesome views.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/brian_far.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/brian_far.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><em>(If you squint you can see Brian)</em></p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/view1_small.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/view1_small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The thing to keep in mind about gravel roads is that they like to get out of sync with the maps. We had to reroute due to roads going in a different direction, and due to various kinds of deadends.</p>

<p>In one extreme case a road was clearly on the map, but had a &#8220;DEAD END&#8221; sign on it. Which got us thinking &#8220;is this a dead end for cars or is it for real?&#8221;. After some climbing, the gravel road reduced to a nice forest path.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/dead1_small.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/dead1_small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Further on it became obvious that someone tried hard to kill this road. Some road hater put up over a dozen tree pile barriers, with some reaching my height.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/piles.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2011-08-09-ride-to-the-coast/piles.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Turned out the road did indeed go through. Perhaps some day someone will start a cyclocross race dedicated to bringing this road back :)</p>

<p>The last highlight of the trip was this delicious-looking buffalo herd.</p>

<p>I love cycling in Oregon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Static analysis can be a very fun pastime. One gets to sift through giant codebases looking for interesting clues, what could be more fun? A couple things qualify: a) static analysis accompanied by cool rewrites b) static analysis accompanied by cool visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Rewrite</strong></p>

<p>Michael Wu&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/mwu/2011/07/28/the-twelve-booleans-of-mozilla/">boolcheck</a> tool is awesome. He wrote it to check that &#8220;typedef int&#8221; bools are really being used as booleans and aren&#8217;t perversely carrying integer values. The process of writing the tool is cool. As Michael is discovers bugs/disagreements stemming from setting &#8220;typedef bool PRBool&#8221;, he just adds another pattern to check for to the tool and never has to worry about that pattern again. I hope to see someone apply boolcheck to the linux kernel, GTK projects or anything else with int booleans. Some projects don&#8217;t have the luxury of switching to real bools, so they can continue using a static checker to make up for it.</p>

<p><strong>Pretty Code</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about <a href="http://dxr.mozilla.org/clang/">DXR</a> many times. As of this week clang-based DXR is on par with the old Dehydra-based one. Callgraph, inheritance, etc queries now work. <a href="http://quetzalcoatal.blogspot.com/">Joshua</a> did an outstanding job gutting and rewriting the DXR backend this summer and is now going back to school. I&#8217;m extremely impressed with his work this summer. I didn&#8217;t think it was possible to get as far as he did.</p>

<p>We are looking for more help with DXR. Please deploy it on your pet project, contribute plugins for various languages, simplify deployment, etc.</p>

<p>Additionally, now that the backed is in a fairly decent shape, we are looking for someone to help us turn DXR into the slickest code browsing tool ever(we have some ideas <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DXR_Future_Work_Plan">written down</a>). I&#8217;d like interactive graphs, various code visualizations, integration with bugzilla, etc. This needs a JSON-query frontend and a few other bits &amp; pieces to be implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Interns Wanted</strong></p>

<p>We would love to hire more static analysis interns. Are you student who dreams about making large codebases easy to grasp? Do you want to spend a few months making Control Flow Graphs behave? If that sounds like your calling: leave a comment, send me an email.</p>
