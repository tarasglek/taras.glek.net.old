  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was an interesting week. On one hand all performance aspects of tab strip work were suspended until end of year on the frontend team, on the other impressive gains were made on platform side of things.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Muizelaar cut tab switch times in half</strong></p>

<p>Data came in on Jeff&#8217;s optimization I mentioned <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/10/04/snappy-39/">last week</a>: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=792199">bug 792199</a>. This halved our median tab switch time. Since this also landed at the end of our 18 cycle, a comparison between 18/19 Nightlies gives us an idea of how this changed our tab switching times overall. Note the actual difference would be greater since both 18 &amp; 19 include data points with Jeff&#8217;s patch, but the majority of data in 18 is without Jeff&#8217;s patch.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2012-10-15-snappy-40-faster-tabswitching-startup-analysis/fx_tab_switch_update.png"><img src="/assets/images/2012-10-15-snappy-40-faster-tabswitching-startup-analysis/fx_tab_switch_update.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><em>Black: v18, Blue V19. X-axis represents time in milliseconds to do a tab switch, excluding time to paint.</em></p>

<p>Above graph shows a shift towards fast tab switch times across the board with particularly nice improvements in the tail. See the corresponding 50% fall in medians on our <a href="https://metrics.mozilla.com/data/content/pentaho-cdf-dd/Render?solution=metrics2&amp;path=%2Ftelemetry&amp;file=telemetryEvolution.wcdf&amp;bookmarkState={%22impl%22%3A%22client%22%2C%22params%22%3A{%22referenceDate%22%3A%222012-10-09%22%2C%22appNameParameter%22%3A%22[Application].[Firefox]%22%2C%22osParameter%22%3A%22[OS].[WINNT]%22%2C%22channelParameter%22%3A%22[Channel].[nightly]%22%2C%22reasonParameter%22%3A%22[Reason].[saved-session]%22%2C%22histogramParameter%22%3A%22[Histogram].[FX_TAB_SWITCH_UPDATE_MS]%22%2C%22histogramPopupTools%22%3A%22%22%2C%22duplicateHistogram%22%3A%22%23duplicateHistogram%22%2C%22medianButtonParam%22%3A0%2C%22scatterChart%22%3A%22%22}}">telemetry evolution dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jeff&#8217;s patch was too good. Instead of decoding less images, it ended up decoding no images at all causing unnecessary flicker when switching tabs. The patch got backed out, but this accident provided us with a good baseline of how fast tab switching can be without decoding images :) Jeff landed a correction in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799335">bug 799335</a>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above graph does not include paint times. Jeff also landed bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800031">800031</a> which measures the complete tab switch duration (including paint time).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2012-10-15-snappy-40-faster-tabswitching-startup-analysis/fx_tab_switch_total.png"><img src="/assets/images/2012-10-15-snappy-40-faster-tabswitching-startup-analysis/fx_tab_switch_total.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Timothy Nikkel&#8217;s Visible Image Decoding</strong></p>

<p>Currently Firefox tends to decode too many images while browsing image-heavy sites. This hurts our total memory consumption, increases tab switch times, etc. Timothy has been posting tests builds in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689623">bug 689623</a> which try to only decode visible images. Please give those builds a spin if you suffer from poor Firefox performance while browsing image-heavy sites.</p>

<p><strong>Startup Time Profiling</strong></p>

<p>Benoit Girard taught the the Gecko profiler how to capture most of browser startup in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799638">799638</a>. This might be the most important achievement so far in tackling startup problems caused by extensions. This means that every Nightly user (and in a few weeks every Firefox user) can install the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler">Gecko profiler</a>, click &#8216;Profile Startup&#8217; and get a report on what makes Firefox startup slow. This can then be posted to bugzilla, <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/">SUMO</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">AMO </a>or this blog so we can easily identify problematic addons, problematic APIs used by addons and the extent of startup overhead contributed by them.</p>

<p>Making extension-aware startup profiling easy has incredible potential for making Firefox startup faster for extension-addicted users. If you can&#8217;t wait to try this out, you can install a <a href="https://raw.github.com/bgirard/Gecko-Profiler-Addon/2d0c32507f21d4e64a5eb3bff091f23d21528ad5/geckoprofiler.xpi">development snapshot</a> of the profiler extension. Feel free to post your startup profile links in a comment.</p>

<p><strong>Proxy-detection</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned last time, Patrick McManus fixed proxy-related jank in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769764">bug 769764</a>. Last week Vladan Djeric analyzed our chromehang data and confirmed that proxy jank went from being one of our top offenders to not happening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We should no longer do proxy-related IO on the main thread now that Patrick McManus landed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769764">bug 769764</a>. Synchronous proxy code resulted in a miserable user experience for people using proxies, but it also affected normal users during proxy-detection. This was one of the top intermittent freezes that we&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<p>Tab switching should be much faster in Firefox 18 than before. Jared Wein got rid of an expensive regexp that was applied during a tab switch in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781588">bug 781588</a>.  Jeff Muizelaar landed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=792199">bug 792199</a> which should make switching to a image-heavy sites much faster. Jared&#8217;s change is already on nightlies, Jeff&#8217;s change should show up tomorrow if everything goes well.</p>

<p>Matt Woodrow landed the huge change that is DLBI in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=539356">bug 539356</a> (yet again). DLBI speeds up reflows, reduces repaints resulting in a more responsive browser. For more details see Robert O&#8217;Callahan&#8217;s <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/UFndiSxW4rU">announcement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Startup Regression </strong></p>

<p>After working on improving startup for the last couple of releases we seem to have regressed it during the 18 cycle. I filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=798130">bug 798130</a> on this. I just noticed the regression a few hours ago. If anyone has ideas on what might&#8217;ve caused it, please comment.</p>

<p><strong>Profiler</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After MozCamp, we held a snappy meet-up at <a href="http://www.noacowork.pl/">NoaCowork</a> in Warsaw. I believe this was one of the most productive weeks I had the pleasure of participating in since I started at Mozilla. My only regret I was not motivated to organize any memorable after-work activities while suffering the MozCamp.EU plague (Mozilla gatherings are great for exchanging global influenza strains).</p>

<p><strong>Profiler</strong></p>

<p>Benoit Girard went through existing and upcoming profiler features. We made sure that everyone in attendance knew how to use the profiler. We also discussed potential UX improvements. Markus Stange is a community contributor who originally designed and implemented the current profiler UI. He attended MozCamp and spent most of Monday with us planning future profiler improvements with Benoit.</p>

<p><strong>Bas-tool: Azure Drawing Tracer</strong></p>

<p>Bas Schouten presented his work-in-progress graphics tracing tool. Our graphics people have been using the Microsoft <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPIX_(Microsoft">PIX tool</a>&amp;ei=D0FYUM2yK4zasgat6IHoCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaEbWMtMB_UAvO0oOb0drynfX-qw) to debug accelerated drawing issues with Direct2D. I believe Bas got fed up with the buggyness and limitations of an otherwise excellent tool and wrote a similar Azure-specific tool with some special Bas-sauce.</p>

<p>Bas-tool presents a graphics trace so one can see how Firefox draws on the screen. Seeing how something is drawn step-by-step helps us see when we not using efficient graphics primitives, are doing redundant invalidations, etc. The tool can also do tricks like bruteforce graphics operations to find redundant ones, etc.</p>

<p>I expect Bas will present this tool + accompanying patches soon.</p>

<p><strong>OMTC &amp; Tab Strip</strong></p>

<p>Current Firefox tab-strip implementation is crufty. It uses expensive graphics primitives, inefficient CSS transitions, implements scrolling/overflow animations in JS and does other non-performant things (tracked by <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593680">bug 593680</a>). These things happen when one keeps adding features without having good profiling/tracing tools.</p>

<p>Tim Taubert lead the effort to prototype a new tab strip that is implemented without JS animations and uses OMTC-friendly, efficient graphics primitives. Bas-tool was used heavily to see whether CSS transitions were animating efficiently. We sorely missed having a layout person around help diagnose layerizing issues, etc. Turns out CSS transition scheduling is very <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753139#c10">jank-sensitive</a>. We may also need come up + implement some new CSS transition to make an attractive tab strip. Good news is that any backend improvements we make in this area should make it easier to implement fluid, responsive web apps.</p>

<p>Tim Taubert, Benoit Girard &amp; Jared Wein cobbled together a desktop OMTC throbber demo where the tab throbber was implemented using CSS rotations which made it animate smoothly through content jank.</p>

<p><strong>Chromehangs</strong></p>

<p>Me, Josh Aas, Vladan Djeric, Lawrence Mandel went through our new non-destructive chromehang report. Chromehangs are multi-second browser stalls that we report via telemetry. See the complete list that we went through <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/chromehangs">here</a>.</p>

<p>Looks our recently-discovered synchronous proxy code and flash are to blame for most of our temporary hangs. Proxy stuff should disappear once bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769764">769764</a> is fixed. <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsujaws.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F04%2F11%2Fopting-in-to-plugins-in-firefox%2F&amp;ei=DUhYUKGvA4eTswbZ94DYCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkVdVAsE90oEm9Ycou1OrBheMdIg">Click-to-play</a> will help with some of the plugin-caused hangs. We will be discussing how to deal with the rest of the plugin-jank in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>My favourite chromehang was the one that pinpointed why downloads jank Firefox so much: bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=789932">789932</a>. We tried to pin this on anti-virus scans, download manager sqlite activity, but the main reason turned out to be very simple. Turns out we do network traffic on a networking thread only to write out file contents to disk on main thread.</p>

<p><strong>Other </strong></p>

<p>Paulo Amadini, Lawrence Mandel, Gavin Sharp and me made plans to get rid of main thread SQL usage in download, addon manager.</p>

<p>Vladan Djeric explained his plans to speed up &amp; reduce jank caused by DOM Local Storage.</p>

<p>Margaret Leibovic worked on removing synchronous cache API usage, added pageload telemetry. She also filed a bug that resulted in 20% faster link navigation in Fennec (bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=789889">789889</a>). Perhaps we should do the same on our Metro build?</p>

<p>Olli Pettay &amp; Felipe Gomes worked on making our social api features not leak memory.</p>

<p>Julian Seward, Mike Hommey, Benoit Girard worked on improving our profiling infrastructure and making it work on Android, B2G, Linux.</p>

<p>Josh Aas, Lawrence &amp; me coordinated on Snappy priorities on necko team.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I missed a few projects, I hope other attendees blog about their work last week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week a few of us attended MozCamp.EU in Warsaw. Me, Benoit &amp; Vlad presented a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozCampEU2012/Schedule/Desktopandmobile/All-About-Performance">talk </a>on performance work. Primary aim of our talk was to inform our community about various performance tools that came to fruition of the past year and how to use them to investigate Firefox performance problems. Hopefully we&#8217;ll see a spike in bug reports with detailed performance information (profiler traces, telemetry histogram+chromehang excepts, etc).</p>

<p>My favourite part of MozCamp was finally meeting some a couple of the impressive community contributors in person. I finally had the pleasure of literally buying beer to thank someone for cleaning up some nasty code. I hope some day we can do a developer-oriented MozCamp-like conference.</p>

<p>My favourite talk was Anant &amp; Tim&#8217;s presentation on WebRTC. There is something incredibly attractive about having an encrypted, cross-browser, firewall-punching p2p implementation (realtime open video conferencing is a nice bonus). See Anant&#8217;s <a href="http://kix.in/2012/09/16/mozcamp-eu-2012-mobilize-mozilla/">blog post</a> for more details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>End of summer is a tough time to make progress because a lot of people are on vacation. Surprisingly, Firefox got some good fixes in since the last update.</p>

<p><strong>Less Slow Startups</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726125">Bug 726125</a>: should get rid of a lot of super-slow startups. Due to an abstraction accident we ended up validating jars more eagerly than expected. Firefox would go on the net (on the main thread) to check the certificate every time a signed jar was opened. There are over 500 signed extensions on AMO with over 14million active users. See the following for background on the (now dead) feature that caused our jar code to go nuts: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/signed-scripts.html">signed scripts</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Bypassing_Security_Restrictions_and_Signing_Code">note on removal of signed script</a> support. Thanks for Nicholas Chaim and Vladan Djeric for fixing this.</p>

<p><strong>Less Proxy Lag (WIP)</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769764#c5">Bug 769764</a>. We have received a lot of strange complaints about Firefox network performance that we could never reproduce. Turned out this was because none of us used proxies. Patrick McManus discovered a lot of synchronous proxy and DNS code in our network stack.</p>

<p>Fix for this should also improve performance for people without proxies since proxy-autodetection code was also doing main thread IO. As a result all of us replacing sync APIs with async ones all of the existing proxy-related addons will have to be updated. Patrick is reaching out to addon authors to make sure addons are updated in time for the next release.</p>

<p><strong>Less UI Repaint Lag</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=786421">Bug 786421</a>: Nightlies got unbearably slow for me recently. Turned out we ended continuously resizing + applying theme + redrawing invisible tooltips on every paint. Thanks for Timothy Nikkel for fixing this. This bug never affected anyone outside of the Nightly/Aurora testers, but it serves as yet another example of how the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler">Gecko Profiler</a> makes it easier than ever to diagnose weird performance problems. The single biggest contribution anyone can do at the moment is to provide instructions of how to reproduce lag with accompanying profiler traces.</p>

<p><strong>Less Gradient Lag</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761393">Bug 761393</a>: Paul Adenot implemented a gradient cache. This was landed as a Telemetry experiment so we can determine what the optimal cache retention strategy is. We&#8217;ll be watching the relationship between GRADIENT_DURATION and GRADIENT_RETENTION_TIME in the coming weeks. Currently rendering gradients cause stalls in the GPU pipeline. In previous experiments we found out that most of the tab-switch rendering time in hardware-accelerated Firefox is spent rendering gradients :(. Gradients are hard to notice for casual users, but they are heavily used in our tab strip and on Google web properties.</p>

<p><strong>MozCamp</strong></p>

<p>I may not have a chance to post the next snappy update as I&#8217;ll be hopping on the plane to Warsaw right after our meeting. If you are attending MozCamp come to our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=MozCampEU2012/Schedule/Desktopandmobile/All-About-Performance">&#8216;All About Performance&#8217; session</a>. Our goal for the talk is to significantly expand the pool of people who can diagnose Firefox (and web) performance problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google code was once the best code-search tool in the business. Then it got shut down, except for a few special instances like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=Startup.BrowserMessageLoopStartTime&amp;origq=Startup.BrowserMessageLoopStartTime&amp;btnG=Search+Trunk">chromium</a>.</p>

<p>Our intern, Jonas Finnemann Jensen, took the re2 code that used to power google code search and integrated it into DXR (among other cleanups). See his blog <a href="http://jonasfj.dk/blog/2012/08/regular-expressions-on-dxr-allizom-org/">post </a>for more details.</p>

<p>Regexps combined with the new instant search feature changed how I search Mozilla code. Instant search means that I&#8217;m constantly refining my search terms to narrow down my results to a minimum before I leave the search page. Digging through Mozilla code is pretty fun now. I believe our development instance* of <a href="http://dxr.allizom.org/search?q=&amp;tree=mozilla-central&amp;redirect=true">DXR</a> is the most pleasant./efficient (even if a bit rough) code indexing solution atm. I no longer miss google code for searching Mozilla.</p>

<p>Now that Mozilla can be searched in a pleasant way, something needs to fill the searching of masses of open source code usecase. Perhaps <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> could plug the &#8220;google code&#8221;-sized gap in developer hearts?</p>

<ul>
<li>we also need to stabilize the development version and move it to <a href="http://dxr.mozilla.org/">dxr.mozilla.org</a>.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Highlights from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-08-23#Incoming">meeting note</a>s for today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tim Taubert worked on Firefox UI speedups</li>
<li>Lots of improvements to the profiler from Benoit Girard</li>
<li>More incremental GC work from Jon Coppeard</li>
<li>Vladan Djeric got all of the security reviews and should be able to land Nicholas Chaim&#8217;s fix for networked certificate validation:<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726125"> bug 726125</a>
We spent most of the meeting discussing bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784512">bug 784512</a>. According several data sources Firefox 15 Beta loads pages slower than 14. Occasionally problems squeeze past our performance testing + telemetry infrastructure, this looks like one of these times. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s quite hard to reduce a few noisy signals to a concrete performance problem. If you can reproduce a performance regression to do with loading webpages/games/etc in FF15 vs FF14, please leave a comment.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the great comments on my <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/08/16/snappy-36/">previous </a>snappy updates. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=783755">Bug 783755</a> should take care of the new cache size pref not sticking. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718910">Bug 718910</a> on hiding Cache directory from Spotlight is making progress too.</p>

<p>Commenter, kumalos, reported a tab switching regression and posted a profile recorded with our <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FPerformance%2FProfiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler&amp;ei=FLw2UKzMO4WXiQLSgoHwAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGPmI44wGwpjRbtR-WT36EdVv-ew">profiler </a>as evidence. This proved to be an example of bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=783748">783748</a>, and lead us to identify a previously unknown issue in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784756">784756</a>. Constructive feedback like this is one of the main reasons I blog.</p>

<p>I highly encourage users interested in improving Firefox performance to use Nightly builds and report bugs with profiler traces attached.</p>

<p><strong>Shutdown Times</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll end with our latest Telemetry data point. This one took a while to get right, but we finally track our shutdown speed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the limitations of the SQLite FTS is that it can&#8217;t do regular expression or substring searches. Jonas is addressing this with <a href="http://jonasfj.dk/blog/2012/08/trilite-fast-string-matching-in-sqlite/">TriLite</a>. Be sure to subscribe to Jonas&#8217; blog for exciting DXR developments coming up within the final two weeks of his internship.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<p>I have been using dates to mark passage of time in the Snappy project. I think I&#8217;ll switch to a simple counter instead. We are ~36 updates into this project.</p>

<p><strong>Blogging</strong></p>

<p>Ludovic Hirlimann <a href="http://sietch-tabr.tumblr.com/post/29404692899/firefox-cache-and-spotlight">blogged</a> about how spotlight spends a lot of time indexing the Firefox network &#8216;Cache&#8217; directory (known problem, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718910">718910</a>). If you experience this problem and would like to see it fixed, please comment in the bug if the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718910#c13">suggested remedy</a> helps.</p>

<p>Tim Taubert <a href="http://timtaubert.de/blog/2012/08/snappy-fixing-new-tab-page-performance-regressions/">wrote</a> about reducing new-tab jank. I mention Tim a lot in these updates. He takes on a lot of interesting bugs in Firefox frontend. Hopefully he&#8217;ll make a habit out of blogging about his work.</p>

<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>

<p>Nick Hurley landed a change to reduce our maximum cache size to 350 megabytes. In order to avoid excessive disk IO traffic old cache size of 1 gigabyte remains in effect until the cache is reset. See bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709297">709297</a> and Nick&#8217;s <a href="http://todesschaf.org/posts/2012/07/25/cache-usage-results.html">blog post</a> for more details. Progress is also being made on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777328">bug 777328</a> so we can move towards not blowing away our cache 10-20% of the time.</p>

<p>Michal Novotny is proceeding with incrementally reducing cache-caused jank that&#8217;s due to holding a lock on the main thread while doing IO on a background thread. He also removing a multitude of synchronous necko APIs, see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=695399">bug 695399</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick McManus is removing synchronous proxy-related code, see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766973">bug 766973</a> for the DNS-related bit. Turns out our proxy code also does all kinds of synchronous operations when detecting proxy configuration, etc. This is being worked on, but hasn&#8217;t been filed yet.</p>

<p>I usually try to highlight work that has already landed, but in this case it is important to point out that the Necko team is working hard on addressing significant problems in the networking code. These problems are tricky and will take a while to fix. The team is relatively new and is still discovering hidden surprises in their codebase.</p>

<p><strong>Profiler</strong></p>

<p>Benoit Girard posted a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10523664/Screenshots/5p.png">preview </a>of view-source in the profiler. This will be handy for figuring out where performance problems lay, especially in JS files that have been preprocessed (our JS preprocessor does not try to keep the line numbers sane).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while DXR lived on a <a href="http://dxr.lanedo.com/">lanedo.com</a> server. Lanedo folks are now done with DXR development. DXR is once again deployed at dxr.mozilla.org. Our Perf intern, Jonas, is driving DXR development this summer. See his <a href="http://jonasfj.dk/blog/2012/08/deploying-dxr-on-dxr-mozilla-org/">progress report</a>. Be sure to subscribe to his blog. He may change how you use DXR as a result of his current work.</p>
