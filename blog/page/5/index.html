  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned before, we are back to investigating some gfx deceleration issues. Preliminary investigation shows that our border+gradient code is inefficient and since Firefox uses these features heavily, we get some epic slowdowns when tab switching.</p>

<p>To test out this theory Bas put up a test build that simply does not draw gradients or borders. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=750871">bug 75087</a>  for a screenshot demonstrating drastic reduction in browser attractiveness. There is also a test build for people suffering from slow drawing to try out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Notes from today&#8217;s meeting are <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-26">here</a>.</p>

<p>No major snappy fixes landed this week. However, if you look in the notes, there are quite a few projects going through the review cycle.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#8217;m most excited by progress in getting rid of the setTimeout on tab click(bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=743877">743877</a>). Neil posted a diagnosis of why we need setTimeout while switching tabs. Tim followed up with a patch to avoid the setTimeout for non-focus bits. On the subject of SetTimeouts: we devised a plan for managing SetTimeout <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/04/18/web-2-0-a-collection-of-settimeouts/">overhead </a>in background tabs. This will involve breaking up our global event queue into a global queue + smaller per-page queues, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=715376">715376</a>. This will not be a pleasant task, but Nathan aims to have a proof of concept ready next week. With this infrastructure we should be able start prioritizing which events we handle and punish misbehaving tabs.</p>

<p>The graphics team is wrapping up the big Android push, freeing up cycles for elsewhere. Bas is back to looking at slowdowns due to hw acceleration (bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721273">721273</a>). Bas is also looking into changing our chrome CSS to be less expensive to paint.</p>

<p>Ehsan is working with Paul to change firefox themes to not be horrible <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650968">performance hogs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A very significant snappy fix <a href="http://blog.kylehuey.com/post/21892343371/fixing-the-memory-leak">landed </a>this week as part of memshrink. It should significantly reduce memory usage and thus cycle-collector pauses, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Update #2</strong>: I missed another very cool Snappy fix: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729133">bug 729133</a>. This is based on revising old assumptions about cache being faster than disk. We learned from telemetry data that a significant portion of disk cache requests are processed slower than they would if we just went straight to network. Firefox now hedges bets and warms up a TCP connection while checking cache. For details see Patricks&#8217;s <a href="http://bitsup.blogspot.com/2012/04/making-firefox-search-snappier.html">blog</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At 15 minutes, this might&#8217;ve been our shortest meeting yet (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-19">notes</a>).</p>

<p>Most of the work happened in <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-19#Front-end_-_Dietrich">frontend stuff</a>. Most notable improvements are reduced screenshot overhead (by taking less screenshots, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744152">744152</a>) and a brand new IE migrator (a step towards fully async places API, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710895">710895</a>).</p>

<p>Work resumed on making peptest return more <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-19#peptest_-_mcote">consistent </a>results.</p>

<p>The necko team decided to take a more involved approach to solve our cache locking(bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722034">722034</a>) which means the fix will land later than we originally hoped for.</p>

<p>My little investigation into setTimeout <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/04/18/web-2-0-a-collection-of-settimeouts/">overhead</a> exposed more overhead than I expected. After our regularly scheduled snappy meeting, we had a follow up meeting to spec out how to change our event handling to cope with this (bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=715376">715376</a>). Our best people are on this :) I asked for someone to prototype an extension to suspend background tab activity, sounds like  Wladimir of adblockplus might lend a hand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier I <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/04/10/argh-at-our-unresponsive-tab-strip-settimeoutfoo-0-can-be-very-harmful/">blogged </a>about terrible UI responsiveness resulting from a poorly placed setTimeout. I&#8217;ve long suspected that SetTimeouts are to blame for everything. Now with help of bz and sfink I have proof.</p>

<p>Turns out webpages like to keep users entertained and spin setTimeout loops to poll the servers to synchronize news tickers, social networking shoe-ins, collaborative editing, etc. Most pages do this regardless of whether they are a background or a foreground tab. Firefox tries to mitigate this by not allowing background tabs to schedule setTimeouts &lt; 2seconds. Turns out this is a pretty weak defense.</p>

<p>In my personal browsing: etherpad, twitter, zimbra burn through cpu cycles. See this bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744470#c12">comment </a>for an example of setTimeout terrorism with less than 10 tabs. In Firefox these setTimeouts cause significant UI lag, but they will also eat your battery life, overheat your laptop, etc. I filed bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=715376">715376</a> to add functionality to cope with this.  The plan is to prioritize foreground tab activity and do exponential setTimeout decay on abusive background tabs. We basically have to write something similar to an OS scheduler. Ideally we&#8217;d also follow that up with unloading idle tabs, ie bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=675539">675539</a>.</p>

<p>If you are curious about what tabs are abusing your browser my <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/tglek@mozilla.com-520630fd738e">diagnostic builds</a> will be available on try in a few hours. Install a <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~tglek/telemetry/ping.telemetry.xpi">modified </a>version of about:telemetry to see the report.</p>

<p><strong>What should well-behaved web apps do?</strong></p>

<p>You can detect when your tab becomes inactive via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onblur">window.onblur</a>, then throttle or disable your page activity. I know using focus is suboptional for this. There is also a vendor-prefixed <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/API/PageVisibility/Page_Visibility_API">visibility api</a> (thanks!).</p>

<p>Now you know why your browser keeps your CPU wide awake :)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>Wrote this post in a rush on the way out, thanks for the visibility links. I am aware that some webpages need to do work in the background. However that work should be as minimal as possible, this is often not the case.</p>

<p><em>Project Idea:</em></p>

<p>Would be nice if someone wrote an extension that goes through tabs and nukes any outstanding setTimeouts/XHRs/etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Notes are<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-12"> here</a>. Time was spent on administrative issues like overlap/conflict between Snappy and Kilimanjaro, plans for security review for Vladan&#8217;s symbol server and bug triage.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m usually really bad at noticing UI lag, but now my mind is focused on tab switching and I notice the lag every time click on tabs (keyboard switching is unaffected). We discussed how to fix tab lag I blogged about <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2012/04/10/argh-at-our-unresponsive-tab-strip-settimeoutfoo-0-can-be-very-harmful/">earlier</a>. It&#8217;s hard because there is some funny interaction between focus and drag &amp; drop and us switching tabs on mousedown. Neil will look into addressing focus issues this week.</p>

<p>Tim is addressing thumbnail capture slowness in bugs: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744388">744388</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742594">742594</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726347">726347</a>.</p>

<p>Paolo is busy switching code away from synchronous places APIs: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728168">728168</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728174">728174</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728142">728142 </a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=739213">739213</a>.</p>

<p>The networking team is expected to make a decision this week on how to fix the big networking cache lock. See Nick&#8217;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-12#Fix_cache_-_hurley">notes</a> on options presented.</p>

<p>Thanks for feedback on preferred snappy update format: we&#8217;ll stick with cherries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned before, I&#8217;ve been a manager for a year. I&#8217;ve focused solely on paper pushing for the past 6 months. Even though I love programming, it&#8217;s surprisingly enjoyable to merely tell others what to do :) However, as all technical managers find out, eventually one gets very bored without doing something technical. So here it goes&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Why The Frick Are My Tabs So Damn Laggy?</strong></p>

<p>****I noticed that tab switching has become unbearable lately. I finally filed a bug and with Gavin&#8217;s help investigated the brokenness. Turned out that we <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/tabbox.xml#800">awesomely</a></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>setTimeout(do_stuff, 0)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in the mousedown handler (bug 743877). This means that I click on my tab, only to suggest to the browser to schedule an event to be handled some time in the future. The browser will also go ahead and flush the existing event queue before getting to handling my event. I measured lag anywhere from 30 to 160+milliseconds before the browser even started handling my click.</p>

<p><em>This code is pretty ancient, why has tab switching gotten slow within the last few months?</em> Turns out we now take a tab thumbnail on every tabselect, which takes >100ms on my machine&#8230; We then carefully use async IO to store that image in our network disk cache. Unfortunately our cache uses locks in creative ways effectively making that code path synchronous (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723577">723577</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723582">723582</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722033">722033</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722034">722034</a>). See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742594">742594</a> for thumbnail jank. Naturally, all of the above + cycle collection + garbage collection + etc gets scheduled right in the middle of handling tab switching :)</p>

<p>Thanks to a strategically misplaced setTimeout, the browser currently can spend a very long time not responding to user input (seconds sometimes). I bet we have a quite a few places that &#8220;solve&#8221; problems with setTimeouts like above.</p>

<p><strong>There is hope</strong></p>

<p>See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=743069">bug 743069</a> for some proof of concept patches on making tab switching more responsive. As far as I can see, there is no technical reason for us to not to have a buttery-smooth tab strip. Next steps are figuring out why XUL draws slowly, throttling other browser activity while interacting with tab strips, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lawrence, thanks for posting <a href="http://lawrencemandel.com/tag/snappy/">snappy updates</a> while I was on leave.</p>

<p>Snappy meetings have gotten a bit dull lately. There hasn&#8217;t been much arguing about what needs fixing, or much discussion, everybody gave status updates and was in agreement. Going forward we will do less status updating, except for major developments to save some energy for discussion.</p>

<p>Discussion centered around personas&#8230;err themes <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650968">murdering </a>firefox performance and goals for q2. Ehsan will post details how to reimplement themes. I made a separate <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/04/05/snappy-apr-5-snappy-goals-for-q2/">post </a>about goals.</p>

<p>Vlad raised a question on whether we should proceed with <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722243">cancellable </a>SQL queries given SQLite limitations. SQLite can only cancel all outstanding queries, which requires us to track carefully what requests are outstanding and/or do some SQLite feature development. Consensus was that we should proceed to avoid embarrassing situations like reading the places database <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=684513">backwards </a>during shutdown.</p>

<p>Lawrence also revamped the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-05">meeting notes</a> to be more readable.  As an experiment I&#8217;m going to paste them in here. Let me know if you prefer my cherry-picking summaries from before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is time to set goals for the next 3 months at Mozilla. A lot of them should be Snappy-related.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, we have made a lot of snappy progress lately. We identified a lot of problematic areas, fixed some of them and the end is in sight for others. It is extremely important that we maintain the current Snappy momentum, such that we can wrap up Snappy this year and move on to scaling Firefox on multiple cores, etc.</p>

<p>The following <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2012-Q2-Goals#Perf">platform goals</a> have been proposed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics: More rendering off main thread (this work is split between graphics/layout), Fix GFX acceleration lag (not yet on wiki)</li>
<li>Layout: More rendering off main thread (this work is split between graphics/layout), Invalidation via DisplayList Analysis</li>
<li>Video: Off main thread rendering (not yet on wiki)</li>
<li>DOM: Prevent [to a reasonable extent] background tabs from starving the main thread, Reduce CC pauses significantly when there are cycles to collect</li>
<li>Perf Team: Async local storage via blocking pageload, Combine IndexedDB/LocalStorage quotas to allow indexeddb to remove prompt, provide js file api (in workers) for all supported platforms, Reorder xul.dll on windows to speed up startup, continue exit(0) progress</li>
<li>Networking: Resolve listed high priority cache locking/async issues</li>
<li>Firefox: Fix top three Snappy offenders - lightweight themes, add-on manager, main thread SQL (under discussion, not on wiki)
We do a lot of work outside of our goal process, so above goals represent only the big ticket items that we&#8217;d like to see accomplished in the near future. There will be other snappy work going on too.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I recently got rid of an old Pioneer receiver in favour of a tiny Class D amplifier. The class D amp is more efficient, sounds better and is approximately 10x cheaper. Did I mention, it&#8217;s tiny?<br /><br />While shopping for a variable voltage regulator for a power supply I discovered that EBay sells fun-looking <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/3-5-28V-to-1-25-26V-DC-DC-Converter-Boost-Buck-Step-Up-Step-Down-Voltage-Module-/260978204562?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3cc3835f92">1.5V-26V regulators.</a>..for $10. I&#8217;ve been eyeing the Busch + Müller E-WERK universal power supply(up to 13.5V) for a while now, but those sell for $110. It&#8217;s no fun spending a hundred bucks on a bike accessory that may not prove useful. I had no choice but to buy the EBay regulator.<br /><br />As my first experiment I tried powering a 12V MR16 light&#8230; it worked, but flickered like mad. A fat capacitor on the regulated side calmed the flicker. Great, now I can use indoor lights to illuminate my outdoor bike rides.<br /><br />Next I tried a 1-meter 12V LED strip, the strip uses a lot less current than the light bulb so it was quite happy.<br /><br />Then I wondered&#8230;could I power decent speakers using dynamo power? $8 <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=220950831774&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:US:1123">ebay amp</a> later&#8230;yes I can! <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Li9MPsIIXjI/T30nOwQeECI/AAAAAAAADCg/Ftik9IGKLlQ/s1600/IMGP4964.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Li9MPsIIXjI/T30nOwQeECI/AAAAAAAADCg/Ftik9IGKLlQ/s320/IMGP4964.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Recipe: dynamo -&gt; rectifier bridge -&gt; high voltage smoothing capacitors -&gt; regulator -&gt; 16V 0.1F cap -&gt; (optional voltmeter) -&gt; ta2024 amp -&gt; speaker[s]<br /><br />By the way, do not buy this ta2024 amp, spend a few dollars extra and get a board with proper audio in. I had to desolder the weirdo 3pin connector and solder on a home-made audio cable. It also comes with extremely crappy capacitors and crappy terminals for remaining connections (vs decent stuff on the $14 ta204 amp).<br /><br />I think this voltage regulator will prove very handy for bike touring + camping. Should be especially fun once I combine the dynamo with a 3.5W solar panel. Buck/boost will prove very handy indeed.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Our baby girl was born recently. We had the house heat off while we stayed at the birth center.<br /><br />Because we live in the future, we were able to to turn on the house heat(&amp; unlock front door) from the car while driving home. The house got down to 10C (50F) while we were away. Thanks to technology, we did not have to endure that temperature upon return :)<br /><br /><b>Vera/Z-Wave</b><br /><br />So far I have my thermostat, door lock, audio amp and some lights hooked up via Z-Wave. Mi Casa Verde <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074WIVJ4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuff05e-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0074WIVJ4">Vera 3</a> controller is the brains of the operation. It took a couple years before I got everything hooked up because the Vera 3 controller is the only viable option, yet is so damn expensive (fair cost should be ~$100). <br />I waited on opensource stuff to get good (ie <a href="http://linuxmce.com/">LinuxMCE</a> + o<a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/">penzwave</a>), but it seems like Z-Wave will be obsolete before there is any useful open source support for it.<br /><br /><b>Impressions</b><br />So far controlling the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052MHPP4/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=stuff05e-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0052MHPP4&amp;adid=06SXD7JN1SWXKBYY9W71">thermostat</a> from my phone/laptop is the killer feature of the system. We like to keep our house barely warm enough. Unfortunately we have an idiotic gas-powered hot air heating system which guarantees that some rooms are too hot while others are freezing. We can finally adjust house temperate depending on what room in the house we are using without running back/forth to the thermostat.<br />This became even more valuable once the baby arrived. Ellen can control temperature/light with one hand without yelling at me to help :)<br /><br />Controlling lights is cool, but it wasn&#8217;t a life-changer.&nbsp; Time taken for unlocking phone, connecting to the controller + execution lag are fairly similar to walking over to the damn light switch. I suspect Ellen will appreciate this more while she has her hands full with baby and can&#8217;t move easily.<br /><br />Same goes for the door lock. We have a code lock on one side of the house and a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NEK6JM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuff05e-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001NEK6JM"> z-wave/code lock</a> on the other. Frankly it takes longer to open the door via phone than to punch in the code. We haven&#8217;t used house-keys since we moved into the house&#8230;cos keys are a pain. Z-Wave makes it easy to change lock combination, check that the door is locked, etc, so it&#8217;s somewhat valuable.<br /><br />The coolest part of the system is ability to group individual device actions. We have a &#8220;house off&#8221; command that locks the door, turns off thermostat, turns of various lights/etc. It&#8217;s great to crawl into bed, poke at the phone and hear various things around the house shutting off.<br /><br /><b>Future</b><br />The Vera controller supports a lot more than just Z-Wave. It can do X10, custom scripts, respond to UPnP commands, schedule commands based on sun-set/rise times, etc. Various Z-Wave doodads also act as status indicators. In the future I plan to setup the thermostat to turn off while the door is open, open/close windows + turn on fans based of indoor/outdoor temp + time of night, etc. It is also possible to have the DHCP server on my lan report for when my phone appears/disappears so vera can turn off thermostat/lights automagically when we leave the house.<br /><br /><b>Alternatives</b><br />I probably spent $300 of real money on various Z-Wave gear + $300 of money suckered out of credit cards on this setup. There are alternatives.<br /><i> </i><br /><i>Lots of time approach</i>: I think one can do a lot of this on the cheap with xbee + atmega + relays. The thermostat is a little trickier, door lock is harder yet. This will involve reinventing the state machine behind Vera and interfacing with android, web, etc clients. I think it would be cool if open source people moved in this direction&#8230;google even made some noise about android-controlled light bulbs(and went quiet), but at the moment one would&nbsp; have to start from scratch.<br /><br /><i>I do what TV tells me:</i> People with more money than sense can pay Verizon/etc a <a href="https://shop.verizon.com/buy/Monitoring-Energy-Saving/Home-Control/Verizon-Home-Monitoring-and-Control/cat30006#order_tab">monthly fee</a> to do a lot of this. Verizon supports a strict subset of what the Vera controller does..but hey, they have TV ads.<br /><br /><i>Less-weird-stuff approach:</i> There are a couple different wifi thermostats on the market atm. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004YZFU1Q/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=stuff05e-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B004YZFU1Q&amp;adid=0T7A7B6RT7YD3PY5NJE1">This one</a> seems like a cheap way to go. Wifi is a lot less weird and proprietary than Z-Wave, but this gets you no closer to controlling lights, doors :)<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br />Now that the initial time/$$$ investment is made,<b> </b>I look forward to tightly coupling my security video, door bell, phone, sound, cooling systems. Motorized blind/window control is stupidly-expensive, so I&#8217;ll probably be rolling my own. There is lots of room left for energy savings + coolness factor improvements.<br /><br /></div>

Apparently blogger doesn&#39;t send comment notifications by default. micasaverde forums are probably your best bet. </div>

Awesome stuff, very cool.  Any tips for those of us who just bought a house and are thinking of looking into all this stuff (ie good resources on getting up to speed on it all)?</div>
