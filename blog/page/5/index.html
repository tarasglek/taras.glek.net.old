  <div class="entry-content"><p>Notes are<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-12"> here</a>. Time was spent on administrative issues like overlap/conflict between Snappy and Kilimanjaro, plans for security review for Vladan&#8217;s symbol server and bug triage.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m usually really bad at noticing UI lag, but now my mind is focused on tab switching and I notice the lag every time click on tabs (keyboard switching is unaffected). We discussed how to fix tab lag I blogged about <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2012/04/10/argh-at-our-unresponsive-tab-strip-settimeoutfoo-0-can-be-very-harmful/">earlier</a>. It&#8217;s hard because there is some funny interaction between focus and drag &amp; drop and us switching tabs on mousedown. Neil will look into addressing focus issues this week.</p>

<p>Tim is addressing thumbnail capture slowness in bugs: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744388">744388</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742594">742594</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726347">726347</a>.</p>

<p>Paolo is busy switching code away from synchronous places APIs: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728168">728168</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728174">728174</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728142">728142 </a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=739213">739213</a>.</p>

<p>The networking team is expected to make a decision this week on how to fix the big networking cache lock. See Nick&#8217;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-12#Fix_cache_-_hurley">notes</a> on options presented.</p>

<p>Thanks for feedback on preferred snappy update format: we&#8217;ll stick with cherries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned before, I&#8217;ve been a manager for a year. I&#8217;ve focused solely on paper pushing for the past 6 months. Even though I love programming, it&#8217;s surprisingly enjoyable to merely tell others what to do :) However, as all technical managers find out, eventually one gets very bored without doing something technical. So here it goes&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Why The Frick Are My Tabs So Damn Laggy?</strong></p>

<p>****I noticed that tab switching has become unbearable lately. I finally filed a bug and with Gavin&#8217;s help investigated the brokenness. Turned out that we <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/tabbox.xml#800">awesomely</a></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>setTimeout(do_stuff, 0)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in the mousedown handler (bug 743877). This means that I click on my tab, only to suggest to the browser to schedule an event to be handled some time in the future. The browser will also go ahead and flush the existing event queue before getting to handling my event. I measured lag anywhere from 30 to 160+milliseconds before the browser even started handling my click.</p>

<p><em>This code is pretty ancient, why has tab switching gotten slow within the last few months?</em> Turns out we now take a tab thumbnail on every tabselect, which takes >100ms on my machine&#8230; We then carefully use async IO to store that image in our network disk cache. Unfortunately our cache uses locks in creative ways effectively making that code path synchronous (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723577">723577</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723582">723582</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722033">722033</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722034">722034</a>). See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742594">742594</a> for thumbnail jank. Naturally, all of the above + cycle collection + garbage collection + etc gets scheduled right in the middle of handling tab switching :)</p>

<p>Thanks to a strategically misplaced setTimeout, the browser currently can spend a very long time not responding to user input (seconds sometimes). I bet we have a quite a few places that &#8220;solve&#8221; problems with setTimeouts like above.</p>

<p><strong>There is hope</strong></p>

<p>See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=743069">bug 743069</a> for some proof of concept patches on making tab switching more responsive. As far as I can see, there is no technical reason for us to not to have a buttery-smooth tab strip. Next steps are figuring out why XUL draws slowly, throttling other browser activity while interacting with tab strips, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lawrence, thanks for posting <a href="http://lawrencemandel.com/tag/snappy/">snappy updates</a> while I was on leave.</p>

<p>Snappy meetings have gotten a bit dull lately. There hasn&#8217;t been much arguing about what needs fixing, or much discussion, everybody gave status updates and was in agreement. Going forward we will do less status updating, except for major developments to save some energy for discussion.</p>

<p>Discussion centered around personas&#8230;err themes <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650968">murdering </a>firefox performance and goals for q2. Ehsan will post details how to reimplement themes. I made a separate <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/04/05/snappy-apr-5-snappy-goals-for-q2/">post </a>about goals.</p>

<p>Vlad raised a question on whether we should proceed with <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722243">cancellable </a>SQL queries given SQLite limitations. SQLite can only cancel all outstanding queries, which requires us to track carefully what requests are outstanding and/or do some SQLite feature development. Consensus was that we should proceed to avoid embarrassing situations like reading the places database <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=684513">backwards </a>during shutdown.</p>

<p>Lawrence also revamped the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-04-05">meeting notes</a> to be more readable.  As an experiment I&#8217;m going to paste them in here. Let me know if you prefer my cherry-picking summaries from before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is time to set goals for the next 3 months at Mozilla. A lot of them should be Snappy-related.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, we have made a lot of snappy progress lately. We identified a lot of problematic areas, fixed some of them and the end is in sight for others. It is extremely important that we maintain the current Snappy momentum, such that we can wrap up Snappy this year and move on to scaling Firefox on multiple cores, etc.</p>

<p>The following <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2012-Q2-Goals#Perf">platform goals</a> have been proposed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics: More rendering off main thread (this work is split between graphics/layout), Fix GFX acceleration lag (not yet on wiki)</li>
<li>Layout: More rendering off main thread (this work is split between graphics/layout), Invalidation via DisplayList Analysis</li>
<li>Video: Off main thread rendering (not yet on wiki)</li>
<li>DOM: Prevent [to a reasonable extent] background tabs from starving the main thread, Reduce CC pauses significantly when there are cycles to collect</li>
<li>Perf Team: Async local storage via blocking pageload, Combine IndexedDB/LocalStorage quotas to allow indexeddb to remove prompt, provide js file api (in workers) for all supported platforms, Reorder xul.dll on windows to speed up startup, continue exit(0) progress</li>
<li>Networking: Resolve listed high priority cache locking/async issues</li>
<li>Firefox: Fix top three Snappy offenders - lightweight themes, add-on manager, main thread SQL (under discussion, not on wiki)
We do a lot of work outside of our goal process, so above goals represent only the big ticket items that we&#8217;d like to see accomplished in the near future. There will be other snappy work going on too.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Firefox 13 became Aurora this week. Firefox 13 is the first release that contains a significant amount of Snappy improvements. Some work got backported to 11 &amp; 12, but 13 is where the bulk of work landed. I am very proud of how much we accomplished in 13.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_613&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;600&#8221; caption=&#8221;Distribution of Snappy fixes&#8221;]<a href="/assets/images/2012-03-16-snappy-march-15th/ff13.png"><img src="/assets/images/2012-03-16-snappy-march-15th/ff13.png" alt="" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>I suspect the unnamed bar mostly consists of bugs that did not get version-tagged, but those should also be FF13.</p>

<p><strong>Smooth Scrolling</strong></p>

<p>About 10 years ago Avi Halachmi embarked on perfecting scrolling via his <a href="http://smoothwheel.mozdev.org/">smoothwheel extention</a>. It may be that Firefox was the first browser to feature kinetic scrolling (with his extension). This Tuesday Avi landed some of those smarts in Firefox; see bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206438">206438</a>. I&#8217;m sad that it took us 10 years to notice an awesome UX improvement like this. However, it is awesome to work with community developers who can focus on in on a particular feature and perfect it to their liking. To me this is what open source is about: enabling amazing people to perfect their software experience (and have everybody else benefit). Thanks, Avi!</p>

<p>My secret plan is to clean up a few primary user experiences and freeze the rest of the browser while the user is interacting via bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=712478">712478</a>. Scrolling is one such activity, watching video is another, typing, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Peptest</strong></p>

<p>There is now a <a href="http://mrcote.info/peptest/">graph</a> for peptest results. Mark is figuring out how to deal with outlier, and considering integrating telemetry histograms.</p>

<p><strong>Cycle Collector</strong></p>

<p>Olli reduced CC lag observed after closing tabs like gmail, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=734057">734057</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WIP</strong></p>

<p>We have fixed a lot of the low-hanging fruit and are working on larger projects at the moment. Going forward I&#8217;ll stick to mentioning projects when they get started, finish, or post builds for people to test.</p>

<p><strong>Plans for Firefox 14</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m very proud of Snappy fixes in Firefox 13, as a result I have high expectations for Firefox 14. The following are within reach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get rid of remaining main thread SQL (including Local Storage).</li>
<li>Make background maintenance tasks interruptable</li>
<li>Fix themes to not ruin our <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650968">startup</a></li>
<li>Teach Firefox to suspend background processing during<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=712478"> user interaction</a></li>
<li>Ensure that graphics acceleration does not <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692557">regress </a>browser responsiveness</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662444">Exit </a>quickly</li>
<li>De-jank animations</li>
<li>Make our network cache more responsive</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the delay in posting this. We don&#8217;t yet have a frontend for tracking SQL performance in Firefox. Had to wait on Xavier to become available to do the <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~xstevens/telemetry/slowsql/">manual reports</a> for me.</p>

<p>product

<p>Last column shows the time it takes to prepopulate DOM local storage for a webpage in milliseconds. It means in the worst case it took 4minutes before the filesystem decided to give us what we asked for. For 95% of the users reporting it took &lt; 1.7seconds to preload local storage, for 75% &lt; 0.36seconds, etc.</p>

<p>Generally IO is quite fast, but these terrible corner cases means that responsible software developers should always do async IO in interactive applications. Note that this has little to do with how we are accessing data from disk and everything to do with disk IO latency being non-deterministic.</p>

<p><strong>What about other SQL queries?</strong></p>

<p>Feel free to explore the other slow SQL queries in the product, most of them already have Snappy:P1 bugs filed. The plan for snappy is to systematically annihilate the worst performing IO in the browser ASAP.</p>

<p>This data shows why doing SQL IO in applications is both a curse and a blessing. On one hand, a general purpose relational database is always going to be slower than an application-specific storage mechanism. On the other hand, it is a very nice abstraction that makes analysis like this trivial.</p>

<p>I cleaned up about:telemetry to be a bit less of a hack. It mostly generates charts using proper DOM manipulations now, so should be easier to contribute to.</p>

<p><strong>Diff Mode</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have a few hundred histograms in telemetry, it&#8217;s become a chore to figure out if something changed. I added a &#8216;Diff&#8217; button which re-polls telemetry since last telemetry-page-load/diff-press and highlights buckets with new activity in red. This is useful for cases when you see lag in the browser, but have no idea what&#8217;s causing it (sort of like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aboutjank/">about:jank</a>). This turns histogram bars red when stuff changed. Unfortunately one still needs a pretty intimate knowledge of the browser to figure out if any of the histograms are related to observed lag.</p>

<p><strong>Search</strong></p>

<p>I added a little input box to make finding relevant histograms quicker.</p>

<p><strong>Help Wanted</strong></p>

<p>If you find any bugs or have improvements to contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/tarasglek/about-telemetry">the source</a>. The updated addon is in the AMO review queue, in the meantime you can jump the queue via <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/146870/abouttelemetry-0.11-tb+fx.xpi?src=devhub">this link</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was away on Thursday, so the following is based on Lawrence&#8217;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Snappy/2012-03-08">notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Work in Progress</strong></p>

<p>The content team is working on reducing lag caused by background tabs (no specific bug numbers in notes, but I suspect <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=734015">734015</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=715376">715376</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674779">674779</a>).</p>

<p>Vlad is almost done with bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722368">722368</a>. This will give us coverage of all SQL activity within Firefox. For queries with private data we will only report duration + database name. Locally, within about:telemetry, we&#8217;ll be able to report full sql strings if the pref for it is turned on.</p>

<p>Vlad is aiming to wrap up cancelable SQL queries next week, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=722243">722243</a>. Apparently he&#8217;s also almost done with the python symbol server for bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=712109">712109</a>.</p>

<p>Pointless-stat()-reducing bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=521264">521264 </a>is asymptotically reaching landing. Paolo is asyncing favicon consumers in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728143">728143 </a>(on the way toward async places). Drew is asyncing content prefs in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699859">699859</a>.</p>

<p>Nick is still working on making cache async in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723577">723577</a>.</p>

<p>Mark decided to change <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/peptest">peptest </a>to be more like talos and to integrate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler">SPS</a>. I am guessing he&#8217;ll blog about this.</p>

<p><strong>Landed This Week</strong></p>

<p>Andrews work in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728460">728460 </a>should result in the cycle collector running less often.</p>

<p>Most depressing bugfix of the week award goes to Rafael. Firefox no longer considers it appropriate to tickle idle-daily observers tasks late during shutdown, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732368">732368</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ask every new Mozilla person to follow planet Mozilla. It&#8217;s the only easiest way to keep an eye on what is going on in Mozilla. Because it is the single most useful source of mozilla news, it irritates me to no end to see funny pictures of cats mixed in with useful posts at a 9:1 ratio. It&#8217;s like the funny pictures, personal agenda people are taking the rest of us hostage. I understand that the official planet policy encourages personal noise, but policies can evolve.</p>

<p>There are multiple proposals on how to fix this situation. IMHO the most correct one is to have planet refocus on relevant content and add noise.mozilla.org for everything else. People who like noise can subscribe to that. Polite people with personal blogs already syndicate moz-tech-only parts of the blogs to planet, others have personal blogs. Arguments on marriage, definition of hate speech, far leftyness, funny cats, other memes really drain the will to live when I want to get work done.</p>

<p>I do think we could use a better code of conduct for people deeply involved in the community. Open source is a bit too good with letting assholes get away with being assholes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>SUMO Problem Investigation</strong></p>

<p>Looks like increase in negative SUMO reports that I mentioned <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/02/27/snappy-feb-23rd/">last time</a> was due to over-counting. There might be some networking regressions, but no general slowdown. Without solid data it&#8217;s hard to tell.</p>

<p>In order to provide more context to make SUMO reports more useful to developers we are looking into allowing users to attach their telemetry data: bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732522">732522</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Work in Progress</strong></p>

<p>There are few exciting landings to report this week, but there is a lot of exciting work going on.</p>

<p>Nick is getting rid of main thread cache locks, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723577">723577</a>. Limited initial testing indicates this can significantly improve Firefox responsiveness.</p>

<p>Brian&#8217;s prefetch nuking bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692255">692255 </a>is moving along. Interactivity profiling is also close to landing, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710935">710935</a>.</p>

<p>Dietrich is pushing automation changes to how we monitor startup so we can alter our startup sequence to show the main window sooner, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=715402">715402</a>.</p>

<p>Vlad tweaked chromehang to work on all windows versions and is working on the serverside component with Benjamin, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=712109">712109</a>.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/1fn0Vz20wu8">our plan</a> on shutting down Firefox efficiently, speak up if I missed an important detail. Rafael is working on this in bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662444">662444</a>.</p>

<p>Jared has landed more of Avi&#8217;s smooth scrolling tweaks on the ux-branch, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198964">198964</a>. Take the <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-ux">ux nightlies</a> for a spin to try improved scrolling.</p>

<p>Dietrich and Andrew are looking into massive CC pauses after resume, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=639262">639262</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Landed</strong></p>

<p>Async livemarks changes landed, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=613588">613588</a>. Macro is following up to fix any slowdown for livemark users.</p>

<p>Nathan landed persistent telemetry, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=707320">707320</a>. It&#8217;s not quite working yet, bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732970">732970</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Local Storage Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Chris wrote a great <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/there-is-no-simple-solution-for-local-storage/">post</a> on DOM Local Storage, the discussion is great. I did a <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2012/02/22/psa-dom-local-storage-considered-harmful/">post</a> on this a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I have some raw data on exactly how slow DOM Local Storage is, I will post it once Xavier has time to yank data properly out of the cluster.</p>
