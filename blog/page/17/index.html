  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel strange working on GCC-specific stuff and then discussing it on planet mozilla as mozilla work. However, without GCC, Dehydra and Treehydra would not be half as awesome (much less feasible even). The power of open source is that it allows us to leverage the entire open source ecosystem to achieve specific goals. When open source projects combine their efforts, not even the biggest software companies can compete as cross-project goals would be incredibly expensive and unpleasant otherwise.</p>

<p>Occasionally, it is very frustrating to see people treat open source software as immutable and independent black boxes. In my personal experience, the browser and the compiler are viewed as finished products and therefore it is OK to bitch and complain about them. That&#8217;s frustrating because the same users could be channeling that energy in a more positive way by reporting bugs, contributing code/documentation, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes these rants result in rather comical conclusions: Ingo&#8217;s <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/328685/">rant</a> is priceless. My perspective on this:</p>

<ul>
<li>what have Linux kernel devs done to help GCC help them?</li>
<li><flame>Sparse is a deadend. Writing compiler code in C is silly, writing analysis code in C is sillier (and frustrating and limiting). Taking a crappy parser and bolting a crappy compiler backend onto it will result in bigger pile of crap :) Given how smart kernel devs are, they sure like wasting their time on crappy solutions in crappy languages.</flame></li>
<li>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if instead of complaining these talented people wrote a GCC plugin to do what they want?
<strong>GCC Plugin Progress</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>I finally landed the massively boring and annoying <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/gcc-moz-plugin-mq/file/24bbb11d7346/gty.diff">GTY patch</a>. I can barely believe that the patch went in so smoothly without excess complaining from GCC devs. From GCC perspective it&#8217;s merely a cosmetic cleanup that affects a large number of headers. For us it enables <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Treehydra">Treehydra</a> to be generated via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Dehydra">Dehydra</a> with little manual effort. It basically makes Treehydra possible without patching GCC. I have another 3-4 patches that need to land before trunk GCC can run the hydras out of the box. Those are mainly localized bugfixes and cleanups so I fully expect them to go in and for GCC 4.5 to rock my world. Once GCC 4.5 ships. analyzing code will depend on a trivial matter of apt-getting(or equivalent) the hydras and specifying the analysis flags on the GCC commandline!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote Fennecmark to automate some of the tasks that I did manually while doing performance debugging.</p>

<p>I tried to capture some of the &#8220;perceived performance&#8221; in numbers. My goal is to focus on user-visible areas of performance. Ideally it will enable us to track performance better to ensure that key features do not regress in performance and enable us to compare Fennec speed on various platforms. I need to spend some quality time with QA people to figure out how to achieve that.</p>

<p>Currently Fennecmark loads a slow-to-load webpage, zooms around it and then pans from the top to the bottom. This measures: responsiveness during pageload, zoom speed and panning lag.</p>

<p>See code at <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/fennecmark">http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/fennecmark</a>.</p>

<p><strong>JSD Instrumentation</strong></p>

<p>Spidermonkey provides an API that allows one to get a notification on every method entry/exit. I was able to do most of my Fennec performance analysis via a component in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470116">bug 470116</a>. My stopwatch component times the execution of every js function call and spits out a log that has been very useful in figuring out what is taking up time in Fennec chrome.</p>

<p><strong>Porkstain</strong></p>

<p>I am itching to write a tool that can instrument large portions of Mozilla code such that it can be profiled across C++/JS boundaries and without any external tool support. I am guessing this would be most useful on platforms with crappy sampling tools, but it would be cool if it made finding slow codepaths easier in general. If you know any lightweight instrumentation techniques, please share.</p>

<p>I wrote a little prototype to insert stopwatch stuff into code deemed interesting by oprofile (stuff in the bug above). The code patching part works well, but it&#8217;s a big runtime hit and outputs too much data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>static on irc.mozilla.org is now the correct irc channel for anything to do with static analysis.</h1>

<p><strong>Codecon</strong> On Sunday, I will be presenting on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">Pork</a> at codecon. I have been meaning to attend <a href="http://www.codecon.org/">codecon</a> since the days when P2P was considered cool, was not able to make it until this year. It is a historical milestone for me. Codecon was how people at Mozilla first heard of Elsa, which is now the foundation of all our refactoring tools (it is also inherited baggage I get to maintain).</p>

<p><strong>Piglet</strong></p>

<p>I adopted <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tglek_mozilla.com/piglet">Piglet</a>, <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/dmandelin/">Dave Mandelin</a>&#8217;s de-oinkification project, and imported it into hg. It feels really good to finally be able to do a make -j without disturbing people nearby with surprise explosions of foul language. I plan to move all relevant static analysis tools into piglet. After that I shall finally merge a dozen or so elsa repositories and end up with Pork consisting of elsa/ + piglet/.</p>

<p><strong>Pork</strong>*</p>

<p>Chris Jones is quietly working on making Pork magnitudes more useful to average developers. It&#8217;s exciting stuff and I&#8217;ll let him announce it when he&#8217;s ready. Between his work and <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/">David Humphrey</a>&#8217;s DXR. I think we are finally going to make it easier to hack on Mozilla for a much wider audience than before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2008/11/07/enabling-prcheck-email-notifications/">prcheck</a>, I was surprised by the errors it found. I expected to find lots of cases of prbool variables having integers assigned into them. Indeed there were some of those, but the most frequent offenders were things like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv,rv);
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in methods with a PRBool return value. In this case (and many similar  return values within macros) the function will likely do the opposite of what was intended if there is an error condition. Here is a less hypothetical <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483589">example</a> in bugzilla.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m thinking that instead of porting the prbool analysis to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Treehydra">Treehydra</a> (such that it&#8217;d based on a less buggy <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">backend</a> and can be integrated into the build) it might be more interesting to ensure that nsresults do not mix with other integer types. That would catch all of the worst prbool offenders and possibly other nsresult misfortunes.</p>

<p><em>Has anyone run into bugs like this that do not involve prbools?</em></p>

<p>I suppose a general solution would be to define a lattice of typedefs with rules specifying which typedefs can be assigned to each other. This would make GCC distinguish certain typedefs as discrete and incompatible types. Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of months ago Stuart casually asked me to investigate Fennec performance for moving about a page, zooming and loading pages in general. Beta 1 contains the result of that:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is little to no hardware graphics acceleration on mobile arm device. That combined with low memory bandwidth results in painfully slow screen updates (10x slower than crappy gfx on the desktop?). The painting engine now works hard to skip redundant draws of the page.</li>
<li>During loading pages or zooming Fennec now only draws the minimum required. In my testing complicated pages load 2-5 times faster. Zooming is now 5 times faster.</li>
<li>There is less DOM querying now. Things like checking an element&#8217;s size can cause pages to reflow resulting in a less responsive UI</li>
</ul>


<p>Other performance highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fennec now features a redesigned firstrun page which not only looks better, but also contributed to a 0.5second startup speedup. Overall Beta 1 should startup is almost a second quicker than the previous release</li>
<li>The JavaScript JIT is now on by default providing a noticeable performance boost throughout Fennec.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love new programming toys and this week is a good one for those. Ever since I laid the foundations for Dehydra I&#8217;ve been dreaming of a world where I can quickly lookup a piece of code(say something that someone complains about on IRC), fix it, get it reviewed and pushed in the most efficient manner possible. Seems that the pieces are finally falling into place.</p>

<ol>
<li>I want quick semantically aware code lookup via <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/dxr/">DXR</a>. And guess what, there is <a href="http://www.visophyte.org/blog/2009/02/19/dxrpy-with-references-against-mailnews-plus-bespin-wishes/">progress</a> in that direction.</li>
<li>I want to DXR to provide a link to edit the code. <a href="http://bespin.mozilla.com/">Bespin</a> looks like the most promising candidate for editing. As an aside, using canvas to do text editing is badass. I salute devs who are crazy enough to prove their point by reimplementing something (hopefully better) from scratch using an approach that hasn&#8217;t been tried before.</li>
<li>I want my changes to be saved as a diff into bugzilla. I want that to be two way so I can edit existing patches and save them as new bugzilla attachments.</li>
<li>From there I&#8217;d like a commit feature in bugzilla so the patch would go through try-then-push cycle that Jesse <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/">described</a>.</li>
<li>Having all this inplace would make it trivial to integrate random features such as crash stack trace navigation or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">Pork</a> automagic refactoring.
Now I&#8217;m sure that most of us would still run Emacs and other desktop editors for longer development tasks. But just imagine being bored with a computer at a webcafe, boring friend, etc and having the ability to quickly jump into in the development process as easily as logging into webmail.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I wrote the initial prototype of Dehydra I pondered how long it would take before it&#8217;s adopted by security guys. Unfortunately, until now take-up has been non-existent. Grep and Perl still seem to rule in that community even though the plain text approach restricts the range of possible security scans.</p>

<p>Normally I would be tempted to rant on how grep is convenient yet limiting. However Ben Kurtz <a href="http://www.awgh.org/?p=73">discovered Dehydra for security scans</a> and did a great job explaining the issues involved. Thanks to Georgi for linking me to Ben&#8217;s post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>LWN <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/315686/">published</a> an article about a tool that does refactoring of C code. Guess what, it&#8217;s yet another tool on top of a crappy C-parser that will never grok C well or even hope to support C++. To my great disappointment the author was not aware of my work on Pork. Clearly I have failed in letting people know that complex C and C++ can be refactored with (somewhat raw, but powerful) open source tools.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Dehydra">Dehydra</a> (which is even mentioned in the first comment, yay!), I also maintain <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">Pork</a> - a fork of oink that is well suited to large-scale refactoring of real-world C/C++ code.</p>

<p>So far pork has been used for &#8220;minor&#8221; things like renaming classes&amp;functions, rotating <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/08/06/outparams-take-2/">outparameters</a> and correcting <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/06/26/status-report-recent-work/">prbool</a> bugs. Additionally, Pork proved itself in an <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/11/02/garburator-works/#comments">experiment</a> which involved rewriting almost every function(ie generating a 3+MB patch) in Mozilla to use garbage collection instead of reference-counting.</p>

<p>So to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring C is hard, but C++ is much harder</li>
<li>For refactoring C++ there is no better toolchain to start with than Pork</li>
<li>Pork shares no code with Dehydra.</li>
<li>Pork is built on the Elsa parser which makes it well-suited for rewriting large amounts of code. Dehydra&#8217;s isn&#8217;t suitable for rewriting code due to GCC providing a very lossy AST and incomplete location information.</li>
<li>Pork is not as convenient for analysis needs as Dehydra
For any questions regarding Pork feel free to post on the <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-static-analysis">mailing list</a> or ping me on IRC.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Language Wars</strong></p>

<p>I find it depressing that the comments to the LWN article ended up being about language wars rather than the refactoring topic. Pork is written in C++ which is much more widely known than OCaml. However, I seriously doubt it&#8217;s easier for anyone to hack on advanced compiler frontend pieces in a language as ill-suited for the task as C++.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The nice folks at FSF <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/2009/msg00000.html">allowed</a> GCC have plugins. In a couple of GCC releases, Dehydra(4.5 if we are lucky) will work with distribution GCCs. Of course the API is yet to be decided on, but we have been coordinating with authors of other GCC plugin efforts to ensure that the final API meets reasonable needs.</p>

<p>In the future enabling static analysis checks will involve little more than specifying &#8211;with-static-checking in your Mozilla build!</p>

<p><strong>JSHydra</strong></p>

<p>The other breakthrough news is that Joshua Cranmer has been working on hooking up a *hydra style API to the Spidermonkey parser. This resulted in <a href="http://quetzalcoatal.blogspot.com/2009/01/jshydra.html">JSHydra</a>. Ability to look into JavaScript has been sorely missing from our stack, so this is extremely exciting.</p>

<li><p>In Soviet Ukraine, kindergarten failed me (luckily they don&#8217;t make you retake that). Apparently when I was six, my handwriting and reading skills were not up to the communist standards of time. I still fondly remember excepts of various communist hymns we got to sing along.</p></li>
<li>Grade 1 coincided with the fall of communism and me getting the most kickass grades of my academic career.</li>
<li>I have owned two cars, but I have since traded that lifestyle for a garage full of bikes. I never liked the effects that driving had on my health nor the effect that crappy German engineering had on my savings.</li>
<li>I met my wife on my first <a href="http://www.momentumplanet.com/features/moonlight-midnight-mystery-ride">midnight mystery ride</a>. Riding at midnight is awesome because that&#8217;s the only time that traffic dies down enough that one sees nothing but fellow bikers and drunk pedestrians.</li>
<li>To buy groceries I ride a comical contraption called an adult tricycle. We even worked the trike into our wedding.</li>
<li><img src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v1925/118/14/122504458/n122504458_33849548_3260.jpg" alt="" /></li>
</ol>


<p>I never had a real job. For some reason all of the Burger Kings and Subways that I applied at never took an interest in me. Instead, in grade 8 my first source of income was teaching Java to someone 2.5x my age for $3 an hour. From then on I bounced around various part-time jobs and internships until I ended up at Mozilla, my first real job.
  7. For a something like six years I wore long hair to go along with my taste for Metal. I&#8217;m always looking for more awesome metal music, currently in heavy rotation are Testament, Winds of Plague, Dying Fetus and Opeth. If you think there is an awesome metal band I might be missing out on, let me know.
