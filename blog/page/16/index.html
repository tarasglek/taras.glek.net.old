  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2008/11/07/enabling-prcheck-email-notifications/">prcheck</a>, I was surprised by the errors it found. I expected to find lots of cases of prbool variables having integers assigned into them. Indeed there were some of those, but the most frequent offenders were things like</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv,rv);
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in methods with a PRBool return value. In this case (and many similar  return values within macros) the function will likely do the opposite of what was intended if there is an error condition. Here is a less hypothetical <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483589">example</a> in bugzilla.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m thinking that instead of porting the prbool analysis to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Treehydra">Treehydra</a> (such that it&#8217;d based on a less buggy <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">backend</a> and can be integrated into the build) it might be more interesting to ensure that nsresults do not mix with other integer types. That would catch all of the worst prbool offenders and possibly other nsresult misfortunes.</p>

<p><em>Has anyone run into bugs like this that do not involve prbools?</em></p>

<p>I suppose a general solution would be to define a lattice of typedefs with rules specifying which typedefs can be assigned to each other. This would make GCC distinguish certain typedefs as discrete and incompatible types. Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of months ago Stuart casually asked me to investigate Fennec performance for moving about a page, zooming and loading pages in general. Beta 1 contains the result of that:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is little to no hardware graphics acceleration on mobile arm device. That combined with low memory bandwidth results in painfully slow screen updates (10x slower than crappy gfx on the desktop?). The painting engine now works hard to skip redundant draws of the page.</li>
<li>During loading pages or zooming Fennec now only draws the minimum required. In my testing complicated pages load 2-5 times faster. Zooming is now 5 times faster.</li>
<li>There is less DOM querying now. Things like checking an element&#8217;s size can cause pages to reflow resulting in a less responsive UI</li>
</ul>


<p>Other performance highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fennec now features a redesigned firstrun page which not only looks better, but also contributed to a 0.5second startup speedup. Overall Beta 1 should startup is almost a second quicker than the previous release</li>
<li>The JavaScript JIT is now on by default providing a noticeable performance boost throughout Fennec.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love new programming toys and this week is a good one for those. Ever since I laid the foundations for Dehydra I&#8217;ve been dreaming of a world where I can quickly lookup a piece of code(say something that someone complains about on IRC), fix it, get it reviewed and pushed in the most efficient manner possible. Seems that the pieces are finally falling into place.</p>

<ol>
<li>I want quick semantically aware code lookup via <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/dxr/">DXR</a>. And guess what, there is <a href="http://www.visophyte.org/blog/2009/02/19/dxrpy-with-references-against-mailnews-plus-bespin-wishes/">progress</a> in that direction.</li>
<li>I want to DXR to provide a link to edit the code. <a href="http://bespin.mozilla.com/">Bespin</a> looks like the most promising candidate for editing. As an aside, using canvas to do text editing is badass. I salute devs who are crazy enough to prove their point by reimplementing something (hopefully better) from scratch using an approach that hasn&#8217;t been tried before.</li>
<li>I want my changes to be saved as a diff into bugzilla. I want that to be two way so I can edit existing patches and save them as new bugzilla attachments.</li>
<li>From there I&#8217;d like a commit feature in bugzilla so the patch would go through try-then-push cycle that Jesse <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/">described</a>.</li>
<li>Having all this inplace would make it trivial to integrate random features such as crash stack trace navigation or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">Pork</a> automagic refactoring.
Now I&#8217;m sure that most of us would still run Emacs and other desktop editors for longer development tasks. But just imagine being bored with a computer at a webcafe, boring friend, etc and having the ability to quickly jump into in the development process as easily as logging into webmail.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I wrote the initial prototype of Dehydra I pondered how long it would take before it&#8217;s adopted by security guys. Unfortunately, until now take-up has been non-existent. Grep and Perl still seem to rule in that community even though the plain text approach restricts the range of possible security scans.</p>

<p>Normally I would be tempted to rant on how grep is convenient yet limiting. However Ben Kurtz <a href="http://www.awgh.org/?p=73">discovered Dehydra for security scans</a> and did a great job explaining the issues involved. Thanks to Georgi for linking me to Ben&#8217;s post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>LWN <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/315686/">published</a> an article about a tool that does refactoring of C code. Guess what, it&#8217;s yet another tool on top of a crappy C-parser that will never grok C well or even hope to support C++. To my great disappointment the author was not aware of my work on Pork. Clearly I have failed in letting people know that complex C and C++ can be refactored with (somewhat raw, but powerful) open source tools.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Dehydra">Dehydra</a> (which is even mentioned in the first comment, yay!), I also maintain <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Pork">Pork</a> - a fork of oink that is well suited to large-scale refactoring of real-world C/C++ code.</p>

<p>So far pork has been used for &#8220;minor&#8221; things like renaming classes&amp;functions, rotating <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/08/06/outparams-take-2/">outparameters</a> and correcting <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/06/26/status-report-recent-work/">prbool</a> bugs. Additionally, Pork proved itself in an <a href="http://taras.glek.net/blog/2007/11/02/garburator-works/#comments">experiment</a> which involved rewriting almost every function(ie generating a 3+MB patch) in Mozilla to use garbage collection instead of reference-counting.</p>

<p>So to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring C is hard, but C++ is much harder</li>
<li>For refactoring C++ there is no better toolchain to start with than Pork</li>
<li>Pork shares no code with Dehydra.</li>
<li>Pork is built on the Elsa parser which makes it well-suited for rewriting large amounts of code. Dehydra&#8217;s isn&#8217;t suitable for rewriting code due to GCC providing a very lossy AST and incomplete location information.</li>
<li>Pork is not as convenient for analysis needs as Dehydra
For any questions regarding Pork feel free to post on the <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-static-analysis">mailing list</a> or ping me on IRC.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Language Wars</strong></p>

<p>I find it depressing that the comments to the LWN article ended up being about language wars rather than the refactoring topic. Pork is written in C++ which is much more widely known than OCaml. However, I seriously doubt it&#8217;s easier for anyone to hack on advanced compiler frontend pieces in a language as ill-suited for the task as C++.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The nice folks at FSF <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/2009/msg00000.html">allowed</a> GCC have plugins. In a couple of GCC releases, Dehydra(4.5 if we are lucky) will work with distribution GCCs. Of course the API is yet to be decided on, but we have been coordinating with authors of other GCC plugin efforts to ensure that the final API meets reasonable needs.</p>

<p>In the future enabling static analysis checks will involve little more than specifying &#8211;with-static-checking in your Mozilla build!</p>

<p><strong>JSHydra</strong></p>

<p>The other breakthrough news is that Joshua Cranmer has been working on hooking up a *hydra style API to the Spidermonkey parser. This resulted in <a href="http://quetzalcoatal.blogspot.com/2009/01/jshydra.html">JSHydra</a>. Ability to look into JavaScript has been sorely missing from our stack, so this is extremely exciting.</p>

<h4>Rules</h4>

<ol>
<li>Link back to your original tagger and list the rules in your post.</li>
<li>Share seven facts about yourself.</li>
<li>Tag some (seven?) people by leaving names and links to their blogs.</li>
<li><p>Let them know they’ve been tagged.
<strong>Seven Things</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In Soviet Ukraine, kindergarten failed me (luckily they don&#8217;t make you retake that). Apparently when I was six, my handwriting and reading skills were not up to the communist standards of time. I still fondly remember excepts of various communist hymns we got to sing along.</p></li>
<li>Grade 1 coincided with the fall of communism and me getting the most kickass grades of my academic career.</li>
<li>I have owned two cars, but I have since traded that lifestyle for a garage full of bikes. I never liked the effects that driving had on my health nor the effect that crappy German engineering had on my savings.</li>
<li>I met my wife on my first <a href="http://www.momentumplanet.com/features/moonlight-midnight-mystery-ride">midnight mystery ride</a>. Riding at midnight is awesome because that&#8217;s the only time that traffic dies down enough that one sees nothing but fellow bikers and drunk pedestrians.</li>
<li>To buy groceries I ride a comical contraption called an adult tricycle. We even worked the trike into our wedding.</li>
<li><img src="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v1925/118/14/122504458/n122504458_33849548_3260.jpg" alt="" /></li>
</ol>


<p>I never had a real job. For some reason all of the Burger Kings and Subways that I applied at never took an interest in me. Instead, in grade 8 my first source of income was teaching Java to someone 2.5x my age for $3 an hour. From then on I bounced around various part-time jobs and internships until I ended up at Mozilla, my first real job.
  7. For a something like six years I wore long hair to go along with my taste for Metal. I&#8217;m always looking for more awesome metal music, currently in heavy rotation are Testament, Winds of Plague, Dying Fetus and Opeth. If you think there is an awesome metal band I might be missing out on, let me know.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Static Analysis vs Performance</strong></p>

<p>Two months ago I got the feeling that I gotta take a break from static analysis and do something that obviously affects Firefox at runtime. Luckily that coincided with ramp-up on Fennec performance work.</p>

<p>I find that I enjoy fixing existing code a lot more than other sorts of programming, so I was extremely happy to switch focus from the static analysis way of fixing code to my other favourite: optimization. Both are peculiar programming endeavours because after a bunch of gruntwork the program ends up doing the exact same thing as before, but better.</p>

<p>In static analysis I focus more on how different pieces fit together, whereas in an optimization I get to focus on what various pieces are trying to achieve so I learned a lot more random Mozilla mysteries.</p>

<p><strong>Fennec</strong></p>

<p>Fennec is pure joy to optimize because it runs in such a constrained Linux environment (compared to desktop Linux). Things seem to happen roughly 10x slower on the arm processor than on my core2duo laptop. Thus performance details that are hard to spot on the desktop almost trivial to discover.</p>

<p>There is no hard drive seeks to introduce unpleasant surprise latency. This simplifies things a lot - there is a lot less variance between hot and cold start on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810">n810</a> than on hard drived desktop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the N810 linux environment also leaves a lot to be desired. Compiling stuff is a chore. It turns out the oprofile produces nonsense results when a compiler of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Build/cs2007q3">recent</a> vintage is used (ancient one cant really compile Mozilla).</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun digging deep into Mozilla code and dealing with <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=465128">mischievous</a> timestamps, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=465556">misbehaving</a> caches and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=466877">rude</a> GC interruptions. All this was done using <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470116">stone-age</a> instrumentation techniques on N810.</p>

<p>Mark Finkle blogged some <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2008/12/fennec-alpha2-performance/">details</a> on Fennec Alpha2 performance. Alpha2 is magnitudes faster than Alpha1, I expect more of the same in subsequent releases.</p>

<p><strong>Software Improvements That  Santa Claus Should Get Me </strong></p>

<p>Even though <a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/">oprofile</a> is useless on N810, one can get a pretty good idea of what the performance issues are from running it on x86. OProfile is a little rough to use, but I&#8217;ve learned to love it when sugared with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot">gprof2dot</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot">xdot</a>. It&#8217;s great for locating places in the code to stick printf()s into.</p>

<p>OProfile has taught me that what I really want is Dtrace (or some knockoff) running on n810.</p>

<p>Also, I really hate how embedded Linux takes away one of coolest things about Desktop Linux: ability to compile own kernel. I haven&#8217;t been able to get a more modern kernel to run on N810 which means I can&#8217;t try a newer version of oprofile or the new omap high res timers. I would also like to get a working image of N810 under qemu, but success has avoided me there too.</p>

<p><strong>Static Stuff</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately I found that can&#8217;t effectively work on static analysis stuff without giving it my full and undivided attention. Right now I&#8217;m hoping to set aside time to focus on writing a more general dead code finder and catch up on other misc things sometime in Janurary or February.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been running my prbool checker with nightly notifications for about a year now. There are some false positivies, but mostly it picks up real bugs. The checker pulls the blame source to try to guess who is responsible for the error, but so far it has only been emailing me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make it emailed the hg blamed person starting this weekend, so if you commit something and get an email from me complaining about it don&#8217;t take it too personally. Hopefully this will keep the amount of new detectable prbool bugs at 0. If you do get an email and decide you don&#8217;t want to get these in the future, please complain and we&#8217;ll try to come up with a better notification solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Open Source projects are often like parallel worlds. People reach the same conclusions, attempt similar solutions and are typically blissfully unaware of each other&#8217;s existance.</p>

<p>Here are two projects that came to my attention this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Via Planet KDE I stumbled on <a href="http://www.englishbreakfastnetwork.org/krazy/">Krazy</a>. It&#8217;s neat if not somewhat depressing that even if C++ parsers are finally becoming accessible all this is still Perl.</li>
<li>Helpful comment on my previous entry pointed me to <a href="http://blogs.linux.ie/caolan/">dead method hunting</a> in OpenOffice.
<strong>Uncool Open Source Rant</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Reason I switched to linux was because it seemed like a developer&#8217;s dream come true. Compilers are a package manager operation away (and generally aren&#8217;t tied to OS versions, I&#8217;m looking at you Apple), everything can be recompiled to address any particular concerns and there are crapload of weird languages to write your software in. This is especially awesome when compared to a typical proprietory software stack where one can&#8217;t easily fix problems that involve multiple components due to licensing issues or due to not having the code available(or due to not having the development environment available). So one would think that Linux distributions hold the ultimate software power: unlimited pass to modify their offering to their target audience&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my view of Linux ways is unrealistic. For example when people do <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/299483/">friggin&#8217; awesome work</a> knocking down boot time to 5 seconds by hacking and slashing their way through the entire software stack involved in boottime delays, distributions claim that it&#8217;s not somethin they can seriously consider because they are too set in their ways of general purpose(and generally bloated) init systems and stock kernels(worst case: why can&#8217;t we recompile the kernel on the user&#8217;s machine or ship a couple of custom variations for common hardware out there). What&#8217;s the point of open source if we continue pretending that everything is a general purpose black box that doesn&#8217;t like to play together? It&#8217;s been two weeks and I haven&#8217;t seen a single distro bite the bullet and attempt to list 5 second boot in their goals. Come on guys, don&#8217;t you like to be challenged?</p>

<p>Hope someone proves me wrong.</p>
